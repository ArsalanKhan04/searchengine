       " 'content': \"( CNN ) The US is ringing in the new year amid a Covid-19 surge that experts warn is exploding at unprecedented speed and could alter daily life for many Americans during the first month of 2022 .\\n`` Omicron is truly everywhere , '' Dr. Megan Ranney , a professor of emergency medicine at Brown University 's School of Public Health , told CNN on Friday night .\\n`` What I am so worried about over the next month or so is that our economy is going to shut down , not because of policies from the federal government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather because so many of us are ill. '' The nation broke records twice this week for its seven-day average of new daily Covid-19 cases , reporting an all-time high average of roughly 355,990 new daily infections Thursday .\\nThe high case count is already causing disruptions in parts of the country .\\nIn New York City , the Metropolitan Transportation Authority ( MTA ) is plagued with staffing issues and announced three subway lines -- the B , Z and W -- which service various parts of the boroughs , have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , we 've been affected by the COVID surge .\\nWe 're running as much train service as we can with the operators we have available , '' the MTA wrote on Twitter Thursday .\\nHealthcare services -- exhausted after several surges of the virus and now stretched thin again by a growing number of Covid-19 patients -- are also already feeling impacts .\\nThe University of Maryland Capital Region Health this week joined a growing list of medical centers in the state to activate emergency protocols after a sharp rise in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departments .\\n`` The current demand for care is depleting our available resources , including staffing , '' UM Capital Region Health said in a statement on Friday .\\nIn Ohio , Gov .\\nMike DeWine on Wednesday announced the deployment of about 1,250 National Guard members as hospitals struggle with staffing shortages .\\n`` Get ready .\\nWe have to remember , in the next few weeks , there 's going to be an unprecedented number of social disruptions , '' Dr. Peter Hotez , dean of Baylor University 's National School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those include flight disruptions as well , he said , because of TSA agent and air crew absences .\\nPrevious rules of virus are 'out the window' The virus is now `` extraordinarily contagious '' and previous mitigation measures that used to help now may not be as helpful , CNN medical analyst Dr. Jonathan Reiner told CNN on Friday .\\n`` At the beginning of this pandemic ... we all were taught , you have a significant exposure if you 're within six feet of somebody and you 're in contact with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All these rules are out the window , '' Reiner said .\\n`` This is a hyper-contagious virus . ''\\nNow , even a quick , transient encounter can lead to an infection , Reiner added , including if someone 's mask is loose , or a person quickly pulls their mask down , or an individual enters an elevator in which someone else has just coughed .\\n`` This is how you can contract this virus , '' Reiner said .\\nThe variant 's transmissibility helps explain the staggering number of infections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nin the past week , several states have reported new case and hospitalization highs , shattering previous records .\\n`` Our hospitals right now are at roughly the same numbers they were on the worst day of last winter 's surge , '' he added .\\n`` The problem is that right now we do n't see any sign of let up . ''\\nOther states , including Arkansas , Maryland and New York , also reported new records for case numbers .\\nAnd a sharp rise in infections -- especially in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spike in hospital admissions , infectious diseases expert Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo said .\\n`` The explosive rise in cases is really fueling what normally might be a relatively small proportion ... of kids who are experiencing these severe outcomes , '' she told CNN 's Amara Walker on Friday .\\n`` But you put the gigantic numbers of cases together with the small number affected , plus the proportion of unvaccinated , and I 'm really worried that we 're going to be in for a tidal wave of admissions , particularly for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the virus spreading , some staff and experts are expressing concern about what school reopenings could mean .\\n`` There will be pediatric hospitalizations , '' Hotez said .\\n`` And what 's going to be the other tough piece in the next weeks , keeping the schools open , because of this high transmissibility -- especially if you start seeing absences of school teachers , bus drivers , cafeteria staff . ''\\nThe Massachusetts Teachers Association , New England 's largest public sector union , urged the state education commissioner this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except for staff Covid-19 testing .\\n`` Using Monday as a day for testing and analyzing data will allow our school districts to make prudent decisions around staffing needs so they can continue in-person learning for students if it is safe or develop contingency plans if a district deems it to be necessary , '' President Merrie Najimy , the association 's president , said in a statement .\\nThe state 's Executive Office of Education said Friday that schools will be open on Monday , despite the teacher union 's request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secondary Education worked hard this week to make at-home rapid tests available to all public school teachers and staff in light of the testing shortages being experienced around the country .\\nMassachusetts is one of only a handful of states supplying rapid tests to its teachers .\\nIt is a not a requirement for teachers to return to work , or necessary to reopen schools after the holiday break , '' Colleen Quinn , a spokesperson for the office , said in a statement .\\n`` It is disappointing , '' the statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MTA is trying to find a way to close schools , which we know is to the extreme detriment of our children . ''\\nMeanwhile , a growing number of colleges and universities across the country are making changes to the beginning of the 2022 spring semester as a result of the case surge .\\n`` I realize that students prefer to be in person , and so do I , '' Samuel L. Stanley Jr. , the university 's president , said in a statement .\\n`` But it is important that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nStarting the semester remotely and de-densifying campus in the coming weeks can be a solution to slowing the spread of the virus .
