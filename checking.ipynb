       "  'content': 'The Pacific year has closed with growing tensions over sovereignty and self-determination issues and growing stress over the ravages of covid-19 pandemic in a region that was largely virus-free in 2020 .\\nJust two days before the year 2021 wrapped up , Bougainville President Ishmael Toroama took the extraordinary statement of denying any involvement by the people or government of the autonomous region of Papua New Guinea being involved in any “ secret plot ” to overthrow the Manasseh Sogavare government in Solomon Islands .\\nInsisting that Bougainville is “ neutral ” in the conflict in neighbouring Solomon Islands where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostilities , Toroama blamed one of PNG ’ s two daily newspapers for stirring the controversy .\\n• READ MORE : Flashback to Kanaky in the 1980s – ‘ Blood on their Banner ’ • New Caledonia referendum : France ’ s last pocket of settler colonialism The frontpage report in the Post-Courier appeared to be a beat-up just at the time Australia was announcing a wind down of the peacekeeping role in the Solomon Islands .\\nA multilateral Pacific force of more than 200 Australian , Fiji , New Zealand and PNG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the riots in a bid to ward off further strife .\\nPNG Police Commissioner David Manning confirmed to the newspaper having receiving reports of Papua New Guineans allegedly training with Solomon Islanders to overthrow the Sogavare government in the New Year .\\nThe Bougainvilleans were also accused of “ leading this alleged covert operation ” in an effort to cause division in Solomon Islands .\\nHowever , Foreign Affairs Minister Soroi Eoe told the newspaper there had been no official information or reports of this alleged operation .\\nThe Solomon Islands Foreign Ministry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toroama warned news media against sensationalising national security issues with its Pacific neighbours , saying the Bougainville Peace Agreement “ explicitly forbids Bougainville to engage in any foreign relations so it is absurd to assume that Bougainville would jeopardise our own political aspirations by acting in defiance ” of these provisions .\\nThis is a highly sensitive time for Bougainville ’ s political aspirations as it negotiates a path in response the 98 percent nonbinding vote in support of independence during the 2019 referendum .\\nIn contrast , another Melanesian territory ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third and final referendum on independence in Kanaky New Caledonia on December 12 where a decisive more than 96 percent voted “ non ” .\\nHowever , less than half ( 43.87 percent ) of the electorate voted – far less than the “ yes ” vote last year – in response to the boycott called by a coalition of seven Kanak independence groups out of respect to the disproportionate number of indigenous people among the 280 who had died in the recent covid-19 outbreak .\\nThe result was a dramatic reversal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2020 where there was a growing vote for independence and the flawed nature of the final plebiscite has been condemned by critics as undoing three decades of progress in decolonisation and race relations .\\nIn 2018 , only 57 percent opposed independence and this dropped to 53 percent in 2020 with every indication that the pro-independence “ oui ” vote would rise further for this third plebiscite in spite of the demographic odds against the indigenous Kanaks who make up just 40 percent of the territory ’ s population of 280,000 .\\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make it difficult to negotiate a shared future with France which annexed Melanesian territory in 1853 and turned it into a penal colony for political prisoners .\\nKanaky turbulence in 1980s A turbulent period in the 1980s – known locally as “ Les événements ” – culminated in a farcical referendum on independence in 1987 which returned a 98 percent rejection of independence .\\nThis was boycotted by the pro-independence groups when then President François Mitterrand broke a promise that short-term French residents would not be able to vote .\\nThe turnout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demographics .\\nThe UN Special Committee on Decolonisation declined to send observers as that plebiscite did not honour the process of “ decolonisation ” .\\nA Kanak international advocate of the Confédération Nationale du Travail ( CNT ) trade union and USTKE member , Rock Haocas , says from Paris that the latest referendum is “ a betrayal ” of the past three decades of progress and jeopardises negotiations for a future statute on the future of Kanaky New Caledonia .\\nThe pro-independence parties have refused to negotiate on the future until after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year .\\nA new political arrangement is due in 18 months .\\nIn the meantime , the result is being challenged in France ’ s constitutional court .\\n“ The people have made concessions , ” Haocas told Asia Pacific Report , referencing the many occasions indigenous Kanaks have done so , such as : • Concessions to the “ two colours , one people ” agreement with the Union Caledonian party in 1953 ; • Recognition of the “ victims of history ” in Nainville-Les-Roches in 1983 ; • The Matignon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nouméa Accord in 1998 ; and • The opening of the electoral body ( to the native ) .\\n‘ Getting closer to each other ’ “ The period of the agreements allowed the different communities to get to know each other , to get closer to each other , to be together in schools , to work together in companies and development projects , to travel in France , the Pacific , and in other countries , ” says Haocas .\\n“ It ’ s also the time of the internet .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it faces the world .\\nPeople talk about it more easily .\\nThe demand for independence has become more explainable , and more exportable .\\nThere has been more talk of interdependence , and no longer of a strict break with France .\\n“ But for the last referendum France banked on the fear of one with the other to preserve its own interests.\\n” Is this a return to the dark days of 1987 when France conducted the “ sham referendum ” ?\\n“ We ’ re not really in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the framework of the Nouméa Accord with three consultations — and for which we asked for the postponement of the last one scheduled for December 12 , ” says Haocas .\\n“ It was for health reasons with its cultural and societal impacts that made the campaign difficult , it was not fundamentally for political reasons .\\n“ The French state does not discuss , does not seek consensus — it imposes , even if it means going back on its word.\\n” Haocas says it is now time to reflect and analyse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The result of the ballot box speaks for itself .\\nNote the calm in the pro-independence world .\\nNow there are no longer three actors — the indépendantistes , the anti-independence and the state – but two , the indépendantistes and the state.\\n” Comparisons between Kanaky and Palestine In a devastating critique of the failings of the referendum and of the sincerity of France ’ s about-turn in its three-decade decolonisation policy , Professor Joseph Massad , a specialist in modern Arab politics and intellectual history at Columbia University , New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartheid in Palestine .\\n“ Its expected result was a defeat for the cause of independence .\\nIt seems that European settler-colonies remain beholden to the white colonists , not only in the larger white settler-colonies in the Americas and Oceania , but also in the smaller ones , whether in the South Pacific , Southern Africa , Palestine , or Hawai ’ i , ” wrote Dr Massad in Middle East Eye .\\n“ Just as Palestine is the only intact European settler-colony in the Arab world after the end of Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1950s , the end of French settler-colonialism in Morocco and Tunisia in the 1950s , and the liberation of Algeria in 1962 ( some of Algeria ’ s French colonists left for New Caledonia ) , Kanaky remains the only major country subject to French settler-colonialism after the independence of most of its island neighbours .\\n“ As with the colonised Palestinians , who have less rights than those acquired by the Kanaks in the last half century , and who remain subject to the racialised power of their colonisers , the colonised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the white French colonists and their mother country .\\n“ No wonder [ President Emmanuel ] Macron is as ebullient and proud as Israel ’ s leaders.\\n” West Papuan hopes elusive as violence worsens Hopes for a new United Nations-supervised referendum for West Papua have remained elusive for the Melanesian region colonised by Indonesia in the 1960s and annexed after a sham plebiscite known euphemistically as the “ Act of Free Choice ” in 1969 when 1025 men and women hand-picked by the Indonesian military voted unanimously in favour of Indonesian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two years ago the United Liberation Movement of West Papua ( ULMWP ) was formed to step up the international diplomatic effort for Papuan self-determination and independence .\\nHowever , at the same time armed resistance has grown and Indonesia has responded with a massive build up of more than 20,000 troops in the two Melanesian provinces of Papua and West Papua and an exponential increase on human rights violations and draconian measures by the Jakarta authorities .\\nAs 2021 ended , interim West Papuan president-in-exile Benny Wenda distributed a Christmas message thanking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solidarity groups , the International Parliamentarians for West Papua , the International Lawyers for West Papua , all those across the world who continue to tirelessly support us .\\n“ Religious leaders , NGOs , politicians , diplomats , individuals , everyone who has helped us in the Pacific , Caribbean , Africa , America , Europe , UK : thank you.\\n” Wenda sounded an optimistic note in his message : “ Our goal is getting closer .\\nPlease help us keep up the momentum in 2022 with your prayers , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making history through your support , which will help us achieve independence.\\n” But Wenda was also frank about the grave situation facing West Papua , which was “ getting worse and worse ” .\\n“ We continue to demand that the Indonesian government release the eight students arrested on December 1 for peacefully calling for their right to self-determination .\\nWe also demand that the military operations , which continue in Intan Jaya , Puncak , Nduga and elsewhere , cease , ” he said , adding condemnation of Jakarta for using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights visiting West Papua .\\nNew covid-19 wave hits Fiji Fiji , which had already suffered earlier in 2021 along with Guam and French Polynesia as one of the worst hit Pacific countries hit by the covid-19 pandemic , is now in the grip of a third wave of infection with 780 active cases .\\nFiji ’ s Health Ministry has reported one death and 309 new cases of covid-19 in the community since Christmas Day — 194 of them confirmed in the 24 hours just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nThis is another blow to the tourism industry just at a time when it was seeking to rebuild .\\nHealth Secretary Dr James Fong is yet to confirm whether these cases were of the delta variant or the more highly contagious omicron mutant .\\nIt may just be a resurgence of the endemic delta variant , says Dr Fong , “ however we are also working on the assumption that the omicron variant is already here , and is being transmitted within the community .\\n“ We expect that genomic sequencing results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirm this in due course.\\n” A DevPolicy blog article at Australian National University earlier in 2021 warned against applying Western notions of public health to the Pacific country .\\nCommunal living is widespread across squatter settlements , urban villages , and other residential areas in the Lami-Suva-Nausori containment zone .\\n“ Household sizes are generally bigger than in Western countries , and households often include three generations .\\nThis means elderly people are more at risk as they can not easily isolate .\\nAt the same time , identifying a ‘ household @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ‘ bubble ’ is difficult .\\n“ ‘ Stay home ’ is equally difficult to define , because the concept of ‘ home ’ has a broader meaning in the Fijian context compared to Western societies.\\n” While covid pandemic crises are continuing to wreak havoc in some Pacific communities into 2022 , the urgency of climate change still remains the critical issue facing the region .\\nAfter the lacklustre COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow , Scotland , in November , Pacific leaders — who were mostly unable to attend due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up their global advocacy .\\nEnd of ’ empty promises ’ on climate Cook Islands Prime Minister Mark Brown appealed in a powerful article that it was time for the major nations producing global warming emissions to shelve their “ empty promises ” and finally deliver on climate financing .\\n‘ As custodians of these islands , we have a moral duty to protect [ them ] — for today and the unborn generations of our Pacific anau .\\nSadly , we are unable to do that because of things beyond our control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nOur food security is at risk , and our way of life that we have known for generations is slowly disappearing .\\nWhat were ‘ once in a lifetime ’ extreme events like category 5 cyclones , marine heatwaves and the like are becoming more severe .\\n“ Despite our negligible contribution to global emissions , this is the price we pay .\\nWe are talking about homes , lands and precious lives ; many are being displaced as we speak.\\n” Perhaps the most perceptive reflections of the year came from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student activist , Marylou Mahé .\\nSaying that as a “ decolonial feminist ” she wished to put an end to “ injustice and humiliation of my people ” , Mahé added a message familiar to many Pacific Islanders : “ As a young Kanak woman , my voice is often silenced , but I want to remind the world that we are here , we are standing , and we are acting for our future .\\nThe state ’ s spoken word may die tomorrow , but our right to recognition and @ @ @ @ @',\n",

       "  'content': 'Simply dismissing , as idiots , those who reject what our government and its science advisors have instructed us about Covid 19 , doesn ’ t help .\\nWhile debates over Covid can be between friends and colleagues , I ’ m concerned that when they involve those ‘ closer to home , ’ the likely long term effects of Covid , risk damaging families for even longer .\\nMore than splits caused by differences over political or religious convictions , most often parlayed in good humoured banter , the seismic cracks caused by the Covid conspiracy debate could take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surrounding landscape .\\nIt all started when a casual comment about the need for us to all follow the new government measures to beat Covid brought forth such a torrent of the now familiar Covid conspiracy rhetoric , from a family member , and I was shocked .\\nWhile we ’ d always hoped that our kids ’ upbringing would instil a certain healthy scepticism , I didn ’ t expect this .\\nBut worse was to come .\\nAfter researching a raft of authoritative material which I thought fairly debunked all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emailed it off , back came an even more violent rebuttal , with some additional “ home truths ” thrown in for good measure .\\nSince then , now many months on , an ozone hole of iciness has opened over our family and the clear signs of a catastrophic climate change seem undeniable .\\nSo I thought I ’ d do some more research and try and find out what has induced so many to be convinced by information so radically opposed to that accepted by the vast majority .\\nWriting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doesn ’ t work with anti-vaxxers because it just reinforces in them the idea that “ I ’ m a brainwashed servant of a conspiracy involving , the government , big pharma and the mainstream media.\\n” And while there are those on the right who are only too ready to exploit people willing to believe the world is not as it appears , Bartlett says the time he spent researching his article , convinced him that the “ antis ” are neither disingenuous nor right-wing nut cases .\\nSo what is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such numbers ?\\nWhat Bartlett noted whenever he produced a verifiable fact , the anti-vaxxer ’ s argument would immediately shift to a different belief system , full of “ coruscating levels of excruciating , nonsensical detail unearthed from ( selective ) online research.\\n” And that certainly tallies with my experience .\\nFor instance Covid conspiracy theorists seem to lack even the slightest appreciation of the astronomical organisational requirements , involving nations literally at war with one another , for such a scheme to ever work .\\n“ But , ” says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fundamentalism where what you believe isn ’ t as important as what you don ’ t believe .\\nWhatever is happening isn ’ t happening .\\nWhatever reality is , they ’ re opposed to it .\\nWhich makes the movement uniquely dangerous.\\n” They exude , “ A sense of righteous zeal that makes them feel that are at war , and so justified in the most extreme actions .\\nThey can harass , they can abuse , they can spread half-truths in the name of their holy mission .\\nThey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of us , fighting an injustice that nobody else can see.\\n” In trying to fathom where all that suddenly came from Bartlett says ; “ This devotion to a cause brings with it a great deal of emotional investment , Their noble mission – whether it ’ s being anti-vaccine or anti-lockdown measures – it ’ s a core part of their identity.\\n” And Bartlett blames education , or a lack of it , for the problem .\\nWhat ’ s needed , he says , is a long-term focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ critical literacy ” .\\nPeople who know how to read the media , with all its biases and omissions , will be less vulnerable to cranks .\\nAnd he argues for a greater focus on basic civics , a simple understanding of how the system works .\\nTo me that echoes a little of nuclear physicist Neil deGrass Tyson ’ s famous quote ; “ The great challenge of life : – Knowing enough to think you ’ re right , but not enough to know you ’ re wrong.\\n” Bartlett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump election campaign which he says , empowered conspiracy theorists by legitimising their ignorance .\\n“ Suddenly knowing nothing was imbued with a certain kind of purity or genius , ” he says .\\nAnd he concludes by advising that a conversation on this subject shouldn ’ t be a battle for a winner and a loser , but for a chance to find some common ground , on which relationships can be still maintained .\\nAnd that makes sense , except that , in my experience , when sides divided by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide what the mask and social distancing protocols are – that ’ s when the argument starts .',\n",

       "  'content': 'THE TRAGEDY OF THE GREENS ’ corruption by neoliberalism is that they simply can not grasp how completely they ’ ve been seduced .\\nAt its heart , the problem is one of generational experience and perspective .\\nThe younger generation of Greens , the ones currently in control of the organisation , simply have no experiential connection to the zeitgeist out of which their movement was born .\\nTheir entire adult lives have been lived in the shadow of the neoliberal revolutions of the 1980s and 90s .\\nWhat came before the revolution has been dismissed by its architects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of common sense .\\nThose who preach the values and aspirations of those pre-revolutionary times offer news from nowhere – and no one is listening .\\nThey could , of course , learn the origin stories of radical environmentalism by entering imaginatively into the historical circumstances out of which it was born .\\nHistorians do this all the time .\\nWatch Mary Beard ’ s television series on Ancient Rome and it will soon become clear how thoroughly an intelligent and inquisitive human-being is able to not only comprehend , but also inhabit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being captured by the history of the Roman world from the moment she read Tacitus ’ chilling judgement of his own people : “ They make a desert and they call it peace.\\n” The problem with the generations that have grown up in the 40 years since Thatcher and Reagan destroyed the post-war social-democratic settlement , is that they have been convinced the past has nothing useful to teach them .\\nLike the early cartographers who wrote “ Here Be Monsters ” in the blank spaces of their maps , the neoliberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before their “ Year Zero ” .\\nAnxious to dissuade those contemplating their own voyages of historical discovery , they warn that only bad and mad things lie beyond the well-charted shorelines of the present .\\nSadly , they have been remarkably successful .\\nThe past remains one of the very few foreign countries that millennial “ influencers ” have no interest in visiting – not least because “ they do things differently there ” .\\nOne of the principal reasons for the neoliberals ’ success is that their own ideologically-inspired break with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the natural inclination of young people to dismiss the world in which their elders were raised as hopelessly passé .\\nOrdinarily , such youthful disdain is reserved for the fashions , art and music of the recent past – so lacking in the manifestly superior tastes of the present .\\nWhat the Neoliberals merged so successfully , however , was this essentially harmless generational scorn with their own deep ideological hostility towards the ideas and institutions of the entire modern era .\\nWhen Baby Boomers like Catherine Delahunty and Sue Bradford condemn the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundational beliefs and principles of the Green Movement , all these younger Greens hear is an ideological version of “ Taylor Swift can ’ t hold a candle to Joni Mitchell.\\n” Or , “ Where is your generation ’ s “ Godfather ” ?\\nWhere ’ s your “ Catcher in the Rye ” ?\\nYour “ Sergeant Pepper ” ?\\nSocial-democracy , the Club of Rome , Rachel Carson , Earth Day 1971 : Catherine and Sue might just as well be touting the virtues of a dusty vinyl version of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 70s ” .\\nOkay Boomer .\\nLacking a firm grasp of recent history , the generations at the end of the alphabet do not understand that while their parents and grandparents might have laughed at the “ RSA Generation ’ s ” stuffy conformism , and marched against nuclear weapons , the Vietnam War and Apartheid sport , they had nothing but admiration for the extraordinary structures of social care which these earlier generations had built .\\nMoreover , they were full of gratitude for the fact that their own lives would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nThe Boomers grew up in the shadow of fascism and genocide .\\nThey knew what the generation preceding their own had beaten back – and they loved them for it .\\nDiscouraged from accessing the past , the younger Greens will struggle to understand the extraordinary exhilaration of encountering their own movement for the first time .\\nNew Zealand was the first nation to encounter a “ green ” political party .\\nInspired by the Club of Rome ’ s “ Limits To Growth ” , the Values Party spoke , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future guided by humility and restraint .\\nTo hear Tony Brunt and his successors talk about limiting economic growth , and expanding the time in which people could simply be themselves , was to envisage a world “ beyond tomorrow ” .\\nThis was news from a somewhere humankind had yet to reach .\\nThe worst crime against History which the Neoliberals have committed , however , is to convince young people that the past was a stinking cesspit of privilege , prejudice and oppression .\\nThat their ancestors were monsters – wiping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and machines laid waste to the forests , lakes , rivers and streams which had sustained them for millennia .\\nBy painting the past as a hellscape of irredeemable horror , the tiny fraction of one percent who lord it over the rest of humanity , Paul Simon ’ s “ loose affiliation of millionaires and billionaires ” are robbing us of the means to rescue the future .\\nIs there horror in the past ?\\nIs it full of murder and rapine ?\\nOf course it is – but no more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nNor are evil deeds all that the past has to show us .\\nAmidst the horror there is heroism .\\nAmidst the murder and rapine there is also empathy and courage , creativity and love .\\nHuman-beings do not suffer injustice meekly , they rise against it again and again and again .\\nDown through the centuries reformers and revolutionaries have dreamed dreams and seen visions .\\nSlavery was abolished .\\nWomen were enfranchised .\\nChildren were removed from coalmines and cotton mills .\\nWhen the armed constabulary invaded Parihaka in 1881 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near all .\\nIn the end , Apartheid fell .\\nEventually , gay sex was decriminalised .\\nThe past is not simply a catalogue of horrors .\\nIt is also an endless source of inspiration and hope .\\nThe Neoliberals would shut the younger generations off from that hope and inspiration .\\nThe neoliberals would have us believe that this is as good as it gets .\\nThey have – almost – convinced James Shaw and Marama Davidson that the future can only be reached with tiny steps .\\nOn a warming planet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that is deadly advice .\\nCatherine and Sue , and all those who stand with them , are right : this is no time for tiny steps .\\nHumankind has made giant leaps before – all the way to the moon .\\nBut the booster rockets that push us towards the future are fuelled by the knowledge of what human-beings have achieved in the past .\\nClio , the Muse of History , is traditionally depicted perusing the book of humanity ’ s past glories .\\nAt need , however , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a sword .\\nNever has that need been greater .\\nOnly when we remember who we are , where we have come from , and what we have achieved , will we find the strength to drive Clio ’ s liberating sword

can only get worse and worse .\\nIf you ’ ve ever wondered at the images of dilapidated tanks , rusted and overgrown , in desolate Third World landscapes , then you have already encountered the paradox of “ parts ” .\\nTanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nIf the replacement parts required to keep them running become unavailable , then these terrifying fighting machines become completely useless – mere scrap-metal .\\nWhat is true of tanks is , of course , also true of John Deere tractors , and all the other agricultural equipment that make New Zealand cockies so productive .\\nThis problem should give serious pause to all those who argue that , in order to prevent these islands being over-run by climate refugees , we will need to arm-up to a degree not before seen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , will have to go up – by a lot .\\nBut , unless we intend ( unrealistically ) to create a large , vertically integrated arms manufacturing industry , the “ Fortress New Zealand ” argument makes no sense .\\nAny country which arms-up immediately makes itself militarily and diplomatically dependent upon the nation state supplying it with weapons .\\nJust think about acquiring that most basic of military tools , the automatic rifle .\\nOnce the shooting starts , a nation ’ s stockpiled ammunition soon runs out .\\nWhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it begs its arms supplier for more .\\nIf , for some reason , the US , or the UK , or Australia , tells New Zealand “ No.\\n” Or , more likely : “ Sorry , mate , we can ’ t spare any at the moment ” , then those automatic rifles instantly become nothing more than expensive metal clubs .\\nObviously , if the weapons your nation is seeking are fighter aircraft or warships , then the supply and maintenance problems are magnified a thousand-fold .\\n“ Fortress New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , we allow ourselves to become a fully-fledged colony of the USA or Australia ( the most likely option , if only from a geographical perspective ) or , maybe , China .\\nEven then , the whole survival scenario rests upon the assumption that the arms-bearing ships from the North keep coming .\\nThe anthropologists tell us that , for a little while after the first Polynesian voyagers made landfall on these islands , the great ocean-going canoes that had carried them here went back and forth between Aotearoa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , the canoes from the North stopped coming .\\nThe men and women who had arrived on these , the last sizeable land-masses to succumb to human occupation , were finally and entirely alone .\\nUntil new sailing vessels arrived from the North .\\nIf those ships hadn ’ t arrived , “ Aotearoa ” would have survived .\\nBut , without its constant and extensive connections with the rest of the world : the very connections most endangered by accelerating Climate Change ;

made by the more enlightened leaders of Pakeha society back in the 1980s and 90s , was crucial .\\nThe settlement process – led and controlled by the Crown – would empower and enrich only a fraction of Maoridom .\\nBut , this small , highly privileged group would , in their turn , guarantee the integrity of the core institutions of the New Zealand state .\\nThe Iwi institutions constructed out of the capital transfers at the heart of the Treaty settlement process were modelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy .\\nThe name given to this phenomenon by Professor Elizabeth Rata is “ neo-tribal capitalism ” .\\nLike the Pakeha system which inspired it , iwi capitalism elevates a very small minority to great wealth and power , while consigning the majority of Māori to a life of exploitation , deprivation and desperation .\\nLike capitalism everywhere , it isn ’ t fair – but it works .\\nIronically , the man who came closest to destroying this mutually beneficial system , in which the elites of both ethnic communities gave away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of New Zealand capitalism ’ s staunchest defenders , Don Brash .\\nPerhaps he intuited that , having indicated their unwillingness to contemplate the force majeure deployed at Bastion Point , the Pakeha elites would inevitably find themselves prevailed upon to transfer more and more power and resources to the iwi-based corporations and the Māori middle-class which serviced them .\\nPerhaps he simply refused to contemplate the evolution of a “ bi-cultural ” state .\\nWhatever the explanation , Brash ’ s controversial Iwi/Kiwi election campaign of 2005 brought him within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force it would take to trash the principles of the Treaty and restore the colonial state to its former glory .\\nBrash ’ s successor , John Key , moved decisively to restore the relationship between the Pakeha and Māori elites .\\nHis reaching out to the Māori Party , and the latter ’ s positive response , confirmed beyond dispute the truth of Geoffrey Palmer ’ s assertion that the settlement process had moved beyond the sanction of “ extreme opinion ” and become part of the mainstream .\\nOver the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) reign , the rapidly expanding Māori middle-class grew progressively more nationalistic .\\nThat they would promote their language and culture with ever-increasing fervour was entirely predictable .\\nHistorically , it has been the practice of all colonised peoples to not only claim full equality with their former masters ’ , but also to elevate the achievements of their own culture well above that of their brutal conquerors .\\nThe strong symbiotic relationship in which erstwhile oppressors and oppressed typically become enmeshed is simply edited out of the ethno-nationalist discourse .\\nThe New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position roughly analogous to that of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the turn of the nineteenth century .\\nThe dominant group is no longer confident of exerting its formal ( but waning ) imperial authority without causing the entire ramshackle edifice to disintegrate .\\nSo uncompromising have the nationalist claims of its subject peoples become that meeting them would instantly dissolve the constitutional glue holding the state together .\\nTo resist their claims means war .\\nUltimately , there is no winning move – but surrender .\\nCertainly , it is difficult to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples , and Jacinda Ardern ’ s decision to allow Nanaia Mahuta to commission a report on its implementation , as anything other than a capitulation to the political logic of Māori nationalism .\\nHe Puapua is an imaginative and honest presentation of the steps necessary to establish a te Tiriti-based constitution based on the principle of co-governance .\\nThe fact that its recommendations , which included the elimination of majority rule , failed to elicit any significant protest from Ardern and her cabinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been persuaded that the future of Aotearoa will be driven by Māori .\\nThe Māori nationalists ideological victory will not , however , be costless .\\nJust as the leaders of Pakeha New Zealand were required to make a choice about the use of force , so , too , will the new rulers of Aotearoa .\\nIt is difficult to see how a system of government permitting 15 percent of the population to determine the fate of the remaining 85 percent can end anything other than badly .\\nPretty early on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like the Pakeha liberals of the 1980s and 90s , will also be forced to choose : Do we preserve our ideological victory and defend our hard won political supremacy by force – or not ?',\n",

       "  'content': 'At 7.30am on 2 January , two missiles were launched by Palestinian Resistance fighters in Gaza , crashing into the sea off Tel Aviv and Palmachim .\\nIsrael held Hamas responsible for the launchings , according to The Times of Israel and responded quickly , with three air strikes on Northern Gaza .\\nThe Palestinian missiles had been fired following a year of massive Israeli ceasefire violations .\\nLast month alone , Israel carried out more than 100 Gaza ceasefire violations , including six waste-laying incursions into the territory .\\nOver the period , there had been little armed Resistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shooting and slight wounding of an Israeli civilian carrying out maintenance work on the border fence with Gaza .\\nThe Israeli response to that , left three Palestinians wounded .\\nOn 4 January , Palestinian Resistance fighters opened fire towards Israeli forces manning the border fence , east of Rafah .\\nThis month appears to forebode an even grimmer outlook for Palestinians subjected to Zionist military dictatorship .\\nBy 9 January , Israel had already carried out 62 Gaza ceasefire violations that included , apart from the air strikes , five Gaza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelling , as well as 17 attacks in which the Israeli Navy opened fire on , and pursued , Palestinian fishing boats .\\nGaza ’ s agricultural areas were subjected to Israeli gunfire 34 times .\\nIn the first nine days of this month , the Israeli Army and Navy carried out a total of 69 attacks on Palestinian targets .\\nIsraeli military and settler violence , combined , resulted in two Palestinians killed and 59 wounded/injured .\\nDuring those first nine days , the Israeli Army carried out raids on 141 towns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including home invasions , 68 of which took place at night .\\nIn addition , Israeli forces inflicted 71 ruinous acts of agricultural/pastoral and economic sabotage in Occupied as well as blockaded areas .\\nIn the West Bank and Jerusalem , from 1-9 January , inclusive , some examples of Israeli cruelty and inhumanity towards the Palestinian people may give just a glimpse of what they have to endure , day after day , year after year , decade upon decade : At 2:10am , the Israeli Army raided Nablus , firing live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tear gas canisters , while storming a number of homes and killing a resident , Bakir Mohammed Musa Hashash .\\nIn Jerusalem , the Israeli Occupation forced a man , Rami Oweida , to destroy his own home in the Silwan neighbourhood – or otherwise be forced to pay an extortionate sum to the Israeli Occupation demolition squads , who would be sent in to do it .\\nA woman , Shaima Dabash , and a man , Ibrahim Abu Kaf , both villagers in Sur Baher , were likewise made to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerusalem another person , Jamal Abu Najma , was forced to destroy his livelihood , a shop , under the same threat .\\nIsraeli forces , near the village of Izbit Salman , seized possession of a bulldozer while the owner , Radwan Othman Qatani , was working on local farmland ; they also forced the family of an Al-Aqsa Mosque security guard to demolish a barn on their farmland – or otherwise be made to pay an extortionate sum to the Israeli Occupation demolition squads , who would be sent in to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ – Israeli Occupation forces , in the village of Khirbet Ibziq , destroyed four tent-dwellings as well as nine more used for raising livestock , along with a water tank and a fodder store , other machinery and , further , more than ten tons of livestock feed .\\nIsraeli Occupation forces , manning a checkpoint , seized possession of a taxi after taking prisoner the driver , Raafat Rasim Al-Barghouti .\\nIn Jerusalem , Israeli soldiers seized possession of a container for transporting goods , along with the property inside it – @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a container for transporting goods , as well as two water-storage tanks .\\nIn Hebron , the Army took a bulldozer being used by a landowner , Nabil Al-Sharha , in the Ein al-Fares area of \\u200b\\u200bDura town , to prevent him from reclaiming his land .\\nIsrael claims that the land is in an area classified as ‘ under its control ’ .\\nThe Occupation plunder included a bulldozer in Madama village , also being used to reclaim village farmland , as well as taking privately-owned al-Isawiya land .\\nIsraeli militants set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounded an area , north-west of Jericho , with a barbed-wire fence so as to establish a new Occupation settlement outpost .\\nIn Jerusalem , the Israeli Occupation issued an order for the building of 3,557 new housing units between the settlements of Givat Hamatos and Har Homa , to join the two and cut off the Jerusalem and Bethlehem neighbourhoods from each other .\\nThe order also provided for another 2,092 housing units to be built on the outskirts of the French Hill in Jerusalem , on yet more Occupied Palestinian land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jarir village farmland , uprooting and chopping down olive trees before removing the surrounding protective fence .\\nIn Jericho – militants , from the Mevot Jericho Occupation settlement outpost , forced shepherds off pastoral land .\\nOn 9 January , Israeli settlers attacked the family of Adel Al-Salameen , a shepherd in the Makasar area , south-east of Tammun , beating up his wife and children as well as robbing one of his sons of a mobile phone .\\nThey also stole a number of the family ’ s sheep .\\nIsraeli settlers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullets , stun grenades and tear gas canisters , invaded Burqa village farmland .\\nOne person , Jamal Tawfiq Hajja , was wounded and there were several tear gas casualties .\\nIn another instance , Israeli Occupation forces fired stun grenades and tear gas canisters towards people who were trying to defend themselves from stone-throwing settlers on the main Jenin-Nablus road .\\nThe world is awakening to this tragedy , whether our leaders and the mainstream media like it or not .\\nIn the past , the world ’ s most powerful leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-determination but international law now provides the moral reason , as well as means , to bring Israel to account .\\nIndividual voices speak out ; one of the most recent is actress Emma Watson , who refuses to submit to the misleading , Zionist smear of ‘ anti-Semitism ’ .\\nOn Instagram , she recently declared her solidarity with the ‘ Free Palestine ’ Movement .\\nMiriam Margolyes , well known for her presentation of Charles Dickens ‘ characters , and who appeared in the Harry Potter films that so enhanced Watson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nShe said : “ I totally support Emma Watson ’ s recent remarks on Palestine .\\nAll decent people should too.\\n” Margolyes made two other crucial comments , which our leaders should consider with care : “ What matters is opposing cruelty , speaking out for compassion ” and “ Criticising Israel is not in itself , an anti-Semitic stance .\\nConflating the two is a form of disguised censorship ” , she concluded .\\nVery revealingly , The Jerusalem Post editorial board , realising the diminishing efficacy of the anti-Semitism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by saying : “ If we shout ‘ antisemitism ’ too often about relatively tame criticism of Israel , and if many people become inured to the shouts , we lose the larger struggle against more serious forms of Jew-hatred.\\n” That would appear to mean that the editors regard Watson ’ s support for Palestinian human rights as , to a degree , a ‘ less serious ’ form of ‘ Jew hatred ’ .\\nThey want it both ways .\\nUnable to hide Zionism ’ s crimes against humanity , Israel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gilad Erdan , commented that “ fiction may work in Harry Potter but it does not work in reality.\\n” His comment drew a response from 40 stars in the entertainment industry , Artists for Palestine , including Miriam Margolyes : “ We join Emma Watson in support of the simple statement that ‘ solidarity is a verb ’ , including meaningful solidarity with Palestinians struggling for their human rights under international law.\\n” The statement also affirms : “ We recognise the underlying power imbalance between Israel , the occupying power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a system of military occupation and apartheid.\\n” Artists for Palestine recognise and condemn the undeniable reality , declaring : “ We stand against ongoing Israeli attempts to forcibly displace Palestinian families from their homes in the East Jerusalem neighbourhoods of Sheikh Jarrah , Silwan and elsewhere in the occupied Palestinian territory.\\n” The international community has passed hundreds of resolutions in the UN Security Council , General Assembly and Human Rights Council , calling on Israel not to annex Palestinian land and not to impose any of the 300 illegal settlements it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank .\\nIsrael has similarly been called upon to end its blockade of Gaza .\\nAll to no avail .\\nIn a recent interview , the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territories , Michael Lynk , reminded the world that there will be no end to Israel ’ s Palestinian human rights violations until it is held fully accountable for them .\\nHe observed “ annexation has been illegal in international law , since the end of the Second World War .\\nThe international community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nations in 1945 that countries are not allowed to have acquisitive ambitions beyond their own borders , either in forms of colonialism or in forms of trying to expand their borders.\\n” Bringing this even more up to date , Lynk drew attention to the 2010 amendments in the Rome Statute on the International Criminal Court which holds annexation to be a crime of aggression .\\nThe Zionist regime ‘ s leaders must be made to understand that if they fail to put an immediate end to their human rights violations they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade , cultural and investment associations and , especially , all arms sales .\\nSadly , world powers , such as the United States , continue to aid Israel .\\nIgnoring a UN Security Council Resolution , the US has still not moved its embassy back to Tel Aviv and it has also failed to revoke the Trump Administration ’ s recognition of Israel ’ s annexation of the Syrian Golan Heights .\\nBoycotting Israel , as exemplified by BDS , is civil society ’ s way of supporting human rights and international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and world leaders .\\nIn the UK there is a move to boycott the Israeli pharmaceutical company , Teva , that profits from the Israeli Occupation .\\nIn general , the international pharmaceutical industry prices drugs sold to each country according to their standard of living .\\nAs a result , Palestinians pay the same prices as in most developed countries .\\nHowever , Palestinians are not allowed to access drugs more cheaply from abroad and so Teva enjoys the advantage of monopoly to sell its own products to them at very high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ s leaders and news media stand on all this ?\\nAre we with our ‘ traditional allies ’ ?\\nOr do we unequivocally support human rights and international law ?\\nThe silence is chilling .',\n",

       "  'content': 'THE BATTLE OVER FREE SPEECH is only likely to grow more intense in 2022 .\\nIf the Labour Government persists with its plans to eliminate “ hate speech ” , and if its allies continue to expand that highly contentious term ’ s definition , then the conflict promises to be epic .\\nAt risk will be nothing less than right of New Zealanders to speak and write freely about their beliefs .\\nShould the year end with a broad definition of hate speech written into New Zealand law , then the 2023 Election will be a particularly vicious and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the essential fabric of civility that protects the practice of our democracy will be rent beyond repair .\\nAlready that fabric is showing signs of serious wear and tear .\\nIn a recent comment , uploaded to the Bowalley Road blog , I read with dismay the following sentences concerning “ Cancel Culture ” : “ Perhaps we should call it consequences culture instead of cancel culture .\\nYou say something people don ’ t like using your freedom of speech , people can react in various ways using their various freedoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nGrow a pair and suck it up.\\n” What makes this statement so concerning is the framing of political and/or cultural debate as a rule-free zone , in which participants should not only expect to be criticised , but also punished , for expressing opinions with which others disagree .\\nOminously , the gratuitous addition of the unabashedly sexist taunt “ grow a pair and suck it up ” makes it clear that the incoming “ criticism ” is much more likely to consist of the sort of vicious personal abuse that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rational , informed and elegantly-styled offerings of traditional critical literature .\\nIt is , however , the word “ punish ” that is most concerning .\\nThe idea that one should expect to be punished for expressing oneself honestly and forthrightly , is one that strikes at the very heart of our democratic culture .\\nBut , before attempting to flesh out what is meant by that term , let us take some time to examine the philosophical parameters of a “ consequences culture ” .\\nIn one sense , all cultures are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are customs , conventions and laws , the flouting and/or breaking of which inevitably entail consequences .\\nThe taking of another ’ s life without just cause brings retribution in all human communities .\\nExpecting anything else would be entirely unrealistic .\\nSocieties also exist , however , in which the articulation of certain ideas risks the direst consequences .\\nTo insult the Prophet Mohammed in a devoutly Muslim country will almost certainly result in the blasphemer being put to death .\\nAttempt to use your freedom of speech in Belarus , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President , Alexander Grigoryevich Lukashenko , and punishment will come hard and fast .\\nIn such settings it is simply nonsensical to speak about the existence of freedom of expression .\\nNo one is free who , the moment they attempt to exercise their freedom , is subjected to some form of punishment .\\nHistorically , the only leftists who subscribed to such a notion tended to be Stalinists and Maoists of the most extreme kind .\\nStalin and Mao ’ s intolerance of free speech was based squarely on the proposition that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the closest approximation to the truth of which humanity was capable .\\nTo suggest otherwise constituted a crime against the truth , and against all the benefits that flow to humanity from the truth .\\nTo attack and defame the disseminators of the truth was tantamount to attacking and defaming humanity itself .\\nTo speak thoughts and articulate beliefs in contradiction of the “ party line ” identified oneself instantly as an “ enemy of the people ” – deserving of the most severe punishment .\\nDid the Far-Right behave similarly ?\\nOf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twentieth century was terribly scarred by the horrific human consequences of regimes which arrogated to themselves total power and total control over their peoples ’ lives .\\nTo suggest that it is somehow okay for the Left to punish people for exercising their freedom of expression – because that is what the Right did , and does – is not only nonsensical ethically , but it also strongly suggests that not too far below the surface of the individuals making such a claim there lurks some disturbingly totalitarian tendencies .\\nThe moral superiority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states is manifested in the political tolerance and civility that constitute their core .\\nWith the obvious caveat that no government is obliged to remain inactive in the face of speech and/or behaviour posing an imminent and direct threat to the physical safety of the persons and property of other human-beings , the democratic state declines to designate certain ideas , beliefs and attitudes as either compulsory or forbidden .\\nWith the faith in reason and science which their forbears inherited from the Enlightenment , democrats remain firm in their conviction that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and frank exchange of ideas by people unconstrained by the fear of saying something that will result in them being locked-up – or worse .\\nThis all-important faith in the truth-revealing power of free discussion and debate imposes upon the citizens of democratic states a very particular code-of-conduct .\\nPeople are to be heard respectfully .\\nAny rebuttal of their arguments should be delivered civilly and on the basis of evidence and reasonable conjecture .\\nUnder no circumstances should abusive or threatening behaviour be tolerated by those either engaged in , or observing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the twenty-first century , the rules that apply to these flesh-and-blood debates , apply with even more force to debates conducted on-line .\\nConsequences culture , or cancel culture ?\\nThe distinction is more apparent than real .\\nTo claim that the most appalling and psychologically damaging personal abuse is nothing more than “ criticism ” ; and to punish those who take an unpopular point of view by pressuring their employers , or boycotting their advertisers ; is to identify oneself not only as an enemy of the tolerance and civility our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also as a common-or-garden bully .\\nThe haters and the bullies can protest that their motivations are pure and uplifting until they are hoarse .\\nThe perpetrators of terrible deeds always justify their actions by claiming they were carried out for the long-term benefit of someone or other .\\nBut we have heard these “ you can ’ t make an omelette without cracking a few eggs ” arguments forever .\\nAt best they signal a we-know-best infantilisation of the very communities they are purporting to assist .\\nAt worst , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eggs that drives them forward .\\nThey ’ re either condescending snobs or psychopaths .\\nThose are the labels Labour ’ s caucus risks pinning on themselves if they fail to step back from their ongoing assault on New Zealand ’ s democratic culture .\\nOnly power , and the lust to retain it – at any cost – are located at the top of the social pyramid .\\nTruth , and the freedom it makes possible , are always to be found further down .\\nForget that , and the consequences for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very serious indeed .',\n",

and • increasing the risk for growing outdoors simply transferred production into factories and industrial estates .\\nGiven the 2020 cannabis referendum dead-even result – which ended the police ’ s social contract to enforce prohibition – and their recent track record of reducing arrests and being the ‘ quiet achievers ’ of NZ drug law reform , it came as little surprise to me that they had dropped the helicopter programme .\\nBut as usual , the devil is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national eradication programme in 2021 , it still allowed police districts to apply for funding to run local programmes if that ’ s what they wanted .\\nThat funding comes from assets seized under the Criminal Proceeds Recovery Act .\\nEvery dollar taken for helicopter joy rides is one less dollar available for drug education or treatment , which come from the same fund .\\nLast year it appears no police districts applied .\\nBut this summer , some areas may experience the sound of choppers hovering over their homes , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nAfter questioning by Green MP Chlöe Swarbrick , police have confirmed that districts may still run their own cannabis aerial operations , even though police HQ have canned the national operation .\\nBut they ’ re not saying where , or when .\\nIt could be lots of places , or nowhere .\\nThey could even just be saying it so fewer people grow .\\nSo we want to track them , and shine a light on what NZ police are really up to .\\nKeep and eye and ear out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and log your reports here – it ’ s Crimebusters for our side Your tip offs could be confirmed sightings of cannabis aerial operations in action ( look for the snorkel hanging below the helicopter to dispense their poison ) , breaches of your peace or your rights , witnessing illegal searches , courtroom shenanigans , and so on .\\nBy letting us know , we can raise public awareness and help more people .\\nChris Fowlie is the president of the National Organisation for the Reform of Marijuana Laws NZ Inc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cannabis social equity ;

       "  'content': 'WHAT WOULD YOU EXPECT from a course devoted to “ Strategic Studies ” ?\\nA reasonable expectation , surely , of a university course devoted to the study of global strategic issues is that it would be ideologically neutral .\\nAfter all , the struggle for global advantage : economically , militarily and diplomatically ; is driven by a wide variety of international actors .\\nBreaking down the conduct of nation states by passing it through a single ideological lens ( of whatever manufacture ) could hardly be described as good scholarship .\\nIt would risk turning out students who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strategic issues at play on the international stage .\\nThan can hardly be the goal of a course called “ Strategic Studies ” – can it ?\\nWhich is not to say that powerful nations , the United States in particular , have not in the past actively rewarded , rather than discouraged , a lack of intellectual curiosity , professional competence , and fundamental human empathy .\\nThe administration of George W. Bush , for example , was famously suspicious of fluent speakers of Arabic .\\nThey feared that such people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\ndemonstrate too much understanding of the nation the United States was planning , in flagrant disregard of international law , to invade .\\nThe government of the United Kingdom similarly distinguished itself by requiring it advisors to provide spurious grounds for joining the US in its illegal invasion of Iraq .\\nIf by “ Strategic Studies ” is meant the training of students to view international events from a single , thoroughly biased , perspective ; and to dutifully supply their employers with material based on falsified data and outright lies ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fundamental human empathy might , indeed , prove prejudicial to rapid advancement in their chosen career .\\nHaving read his Newsroom posting entitled “ Russian Aggression Exposes Gap In NZ ’ s Diplomatic Toolkit ” , it is very difficult to avoid the suspicion that Professor Robert Ayson subscribes to something disappointingly close to the above definition of Strategic Studies .\\nIt will doubtless come as no surprise that the professor ’ s perspective on New Zealand ’ s foreign relations locates the United States of America squarely in the centre of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posting begins with what amounts to a huge sigh of relief that the dangerously heterodox Winston Peters is no longer this country ’ s Foreign Minister .\\nThe good professor wastes no time in reassuring his readers that : “ Labour ceased subcontracting foreign policy to New Zealand First after the 2020 election .\\nPeters ’ quest to advance free trade discussions with Russia and its Eurasian economic partners , which was written into the 2017 coalition agreement , is now history.\\n” The notion that New Zealand might derive considerable benefit from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly does not fall within Professor Ayson ’ s definition of strategic studies .\\nAlso excluded , presumably , is the idea that the Russian Federation is a strategic player meriting a level of analysis more rigorous than the shrieking of Fox News .\\nClearly , the brand of Strategic Studies favoured at Victoria University relies heavily on setting forth the measures best calculated to disrupt and punish the activities of a frightening cast of international bogeymen , the biggest and baddest of which is , of course , Russia – as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late-nineteenth century .\\nJudging by his enthusiasm for the concept , Professor Ayson appears convinced that the most helpful contribution New Zealand can make to discombobulating the Russian bogeyman is to join with the United States and its other sycophants – sorry , “ allies ” – in imposing “ autonomous ” ( i.e .\\nunauthorised by the United Nations Security Council ) economic and diplomatic sanctions .\\nIn other universities , strategic studies professors might encourage their students to calculate how close such unilaterally imposed sanctions come to actual acts of war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies professors might even invite their classes to consider the consequences of the economic sanctions imposed on Japan in 1940 – most particularly the “ embargo ” on oil and scrap-metal exports .\\nTo what extent were such strategic gestures intended to produce a strategic response ?\\nDid the USA ’ s “ autonomous sanctions ” make Pearl Harbour inevitable ?\\nWas that their purpose ?\\nCertainly , as one reads the professor ’ s post , it is difficult to rid one ’ s mind of the image of him bouncing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Russian invasion of Ukraine .\\nNot only would an invasion allow the Ardern Government to join “ a largely Western chorus of condemnation ” and announce ( probably reluctantly ) New Zealand ’ s own autonomous sanctions against the Russian Federation , but it would also vindicate the “ Bogeyman School ” of strategic studies .\\nThat the current Foreign Minister might be a less than fanatical convert to the Bogeyman School clearly concerns Professor Ayson : “ Partway through 2021 , Nanaia Mahuta – Labour ’ s replacement for Peters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auspices being used to criticise the human rights records of other governments ( in this case China ) .\\n” As well she might !\\nIn the eyes of some strategic scholars ( although probably not those at Vic ) the “ Five Eyes ” penchant for throwing their weight around descends in a direct line from the egregious Anglophone imperialism that transformed millions of Chinese citizens into opium addicts – reaping super-profits for the same British drug cartel that seized Hong Kong .\\nNot anymore !\\nProfessor Ayson is certain that : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlikely to stand in the way of New Zealand joining a Five Eyes statement condemning a Russian invasion .\\nSuch an act of military aggression by one sovereign state on another is a good fit with the group ’ s traditional intelligence and security agenda.\\n” Is Professor Ayson on record demanding an equivalent statement of condemnation when three of the Five Eyes Powers engaged in an act of military aggression against the sovereign state of Iraq in 2003 ?\\nOr , was he one of the depressing number of New Zealand strategists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggressive war ( for which politicians were executed at Nuremburg ) as a “ good fit ” for this country ’ s “ traditional intelligence and security agenda.\\n” Fortunately for New Zealand ’ s excellent international reputation , our prime minister , Helen Clark , did not .\\nIt is always possible , of course , that there is at least one student attending Professor Ayson ’ s classes with sufficient gumption to ask why the United States does not accord to President Vladimir Putin the same right to defend his nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims for itself .\\nFor very nearly 200 years the “ Monroe Doctrine ” has warned-off from the entire Western Hemisphere any and all powers with designs to project their power within it .\\nThat same plucky student might also inquire of his professor why sauce for the American goose is not also sauce for the Russian gander ?\\nIt would certainly be interesting to hear Professor Ayson ’ s view of what the most likely response of the United States would be if Russian troops took up positions alongside their Mexican allies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think of the grade an essay advancing these ideas and questions might receive from the head of Victoria University of Wellington ’ s School of Strategic Studies .\\nOne suspects , at the very least , a fusillade of academic criticism would rake its author ’ s position .\\nToo much intellectual curiosity – not enough Fox News .',\n",

       "  'content': 'OMICRON HAS ARRIVED and , not unreasonably , its spread will monopolise the attention of our news media for weeks to come .\\nBut this latest variant of Covid-19 is very far from the only challenge facing New Zealanders .\\nA highly disruptive economic phenomenon , not seen in this country for a whole generation , is making a disconcerting reappearance .\\nAn inflation rate significantly higher than the 1-2 percent per annum tolerated by the Reserve Bank since the late 1980s is threatening to further complicate an already fiendishly complex socio-economic equation .\\nThe eradication of excessive inflation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neoliberal revolution .\\nSqueezing constant price rises out of the system would be an achievement consumers were bound to notice .\\nIndeed , the restoration of price stability would be presented – and largely accepted – as justification for the many other , often wrenching , upheavals of the reform period .\\nFor the neoliberals , knocking inflation for six came with added benefits .\\nAt a stroke , the key justification for cost-of-living adjustments to wage rates would be removed .\\nBack in the days when most wage-workers belonged to a trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of goods and services was compensated for with corresponding rises in the cost of labour .\\nThis was the “ wage-price spiral ” , which most economists characterised as the fundamental explanation for inflation becoming economically “ entrenched ” .\\nTheir favourite metaphor was of a dog chasing its own tail .\\nIt was absolutely crucial , they argued , not only to eliminate high inflation , but also to remove high “ inflationary expectations ” from the minds of wage- and salary-earners .\\nSo long as workers believed that prices were bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union-negotiated wage agreement , they would take care not only to secure an increase to cover the price rises that had already occurred , but also to secure an additional margin sufficient to cover future increases .\\nShould the employers be prevailed upon to meet their employees ’ wage demands , the typical response was to recover their costs by raising prices .\\nUpwards and upwards inflation spiralled , to the general frustration of the whole population .\\nParticularly aggrieved were those on fixed incomes : transfer payments whose value , in almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by excessive inflation rates .\\nEven if adjusted to accommodate historic inflation , pensions and benefits were almost never adjusted to meet future increases in the cost of living .\\nThe inevitable loss of purchasing power meant that those on fixed incomes became poorer and poorer .\\nNot everybody living under high inflation was unhappy .\\nPeople who borrowed heavily to purchase a house , for example , watched in glee as what had seemed a colossal mortgage continued to shrink , in a relative sense , until , after a few years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a mere bagatelle .\\nThanks to the steady increases in their salaries , paying off the bank got easier and easier .\\nWhat was not to like ?\\nPlenty , if you were a coupon-clipping investor .\\nIf the rate of inflation exceeded the fixed rate of interest on a long-term investment , then your purchasing power was bound to suffer .\\nThe sum agreed for making your funds available to the borrower may have seemed generous when originally negotiated , but its value , in real terms , upon maturation could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the neoliberal economists ’ recommended solution for excessive inflation – a sharp increase in the price of money – i.e .\\nhigh interest rates – could always count on the vociferous support of the rentier class .\\nJacking up interest rates , suddenly and substantially , certainly reduces inflation , but only at the deliberately incurred cost of crashing the economy .\\nWithout easy access to credit , marginal businesses falter and fail .\\nWorkers are laid off in their thousands , and the consequent savage reduction in overall purchasing power precipitates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nWith demand for goods and services plummeting , any attempt to preserve a business ’ s income-stream by raising prices becomes commercially suicidal .\\nWith unemployment rising steadily ( along with the supply of labour ) the ability of workers ’ unions to extract pay rises from their bosses falls away to nothing .\\nIncreasingly , the individual worker ’ s purchasing power is maintained by his taking on more and more debt .\\nAn indebted worker is a quiescent worker , so the wage-price spiral ceases as abruptly as the effectiveness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion .\\nSuch inflation as remains in the system now works against the income share of the workforce , who find themselves working longer and harder for what is , in real ( i.e .\\ninflation-adjusted ) terms – less .\\nRight now , New Zealand is at the pre-crashing the economy stage of the battle against inflation .\\nBut , with annual inflation nudging 6 percent , a level New Zealand has not seen for more than a decade , the demands of the neoliberal economists for a series of quite sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strident .\\nThey are deeply concerned that the combination of supply-chain interruptions raising demand ( and , hence , prices ) and a serious labour shortage allowing workers to bid-up their wages , are settling inflationary expectations into the nation ’ s consciousness .\\nThere is a great deal the neoliberal establishment will risk to eradicate those expectations – up to and including deliberately throwing the New Zealand economy into recession .\\nAs always , that will be very bad news for most of us , but quite encouraging news for some .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ see thousands of mortgage holders default on their loans and lose their homes .\\nThe resulting surge in mortgagee sales , by expanding the supply of properties on the market , will precipitate a sharp fall in house prices across New Zealand .\\nWhile that is not an outcome likely to recommend itself to older home-owners accustomed to seeing the value of their property go up and up – not down and down – there will be many younger New Zealanders who are willing to admit , quietly and privately : “ This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so bad ” .',\n",

horror and outrage that the perpetrators of this exercise in maintaining class ( and , let ’ s be honest , racial ) privilege were Labour and Green politicians .\\nLabour gave away its historical role as the workers ’ friend in 1984 – nearly 40 years ago .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduction of “ Rogernomics ” , the Labour Party has occupied the Treasury Benches for a total of nearly 14 years .\\nIn all that time , it has made no serious attempt to dismantle the neoliberal regime it created .\\nExpecting Jacinda Ardern to behave like Mickey Savage is just silly .\\nEspecially when you consider the makeup of New Zealand ’ s House of Representatives .\\nLabour , an unabashedly capitalist party , holds 65 seats .\\nNational , another unabashedly capitalist party , holds 35 seats .\\nAct , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nThe Greens , supposedly not a capitalist party , but one which has , to date , done nothing to suggest that it is an anti-capitalist party , also holds 10 seats .\\nWhich leaves the Māori Party , an ethno-nationalist party which appears to be okay with capitalism – but only if it ’ s Māori capitalism – with just 2 seats .\\nThe question I would put to Mr Hickey is : How would he have persuaded this House of Representatives , composed more-or-less entirely of MPs committed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , to adopt policies which differed in any meaningful way from those actually implemented by the Labour Government of Jacinda Ardern ?\\nNot forgetting that for the first few months of the Covid-19 pandemic , the Prime Minister was dependent on the support of NZ First – a party convinced that capitalism could , and should , do better .\\nPresumably , Mr Hickey believes that New Zealand ’ s parliamentarians , alerted to the sheer bloody inequity of their Covid response , should have felt obliged to come up with something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would they feel obliged to do that ?\\nJust recently I learned that in the United States the friends of capitalism ( about 90 percent of the country ) not only believe in the doctrine of laissez-faire – French for letting the market rip – but that they also subscribe to what they call “ lazy-fair ” .\\nApparently , because so many of the underprivileged are lazy , it ’ s only fair that they ’ re poor .\\nI know , I know , it ’ s an awful thing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it raises a good guffaw among the Country Club set .\\nBut , you know what ?\\nAlthough they would never repeat such an awful “ joke ” out loud , there are plenty of Kiwi MPs ( some of them in the Labour Party ) who subscribe wholeheartedly to the underlying philosophy of the “ deserving ” and “ undeserving ” poor .\\nEven worse , there are hundreds-of-thousands of ordinary Kiwi voters who subscribe to exactly the same philosophy – with bells on .\\nThe awful truth about New Zealand politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties are just too scared to suggest anything like the massive transfer of wealth to the “ current and future renters ” whom Mr Hickey clearly believes the Government ’ s Covid response should have targeted .\\nThe only way such a transfer could possibly have eventuated is in a political context dominated by the electoral success of a party aggressively representing the interests of the working poor and beneficiaries .\\nAssuming such a party drew the bulk of its support from the 700,000 eligible voters who declined to participate in the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered both possible and acceptable would be huge .\\nThe problem , of course , is that every party which has tried to mobilise these voters has failed miserably .\\nThe Internet-Mana Party may have had a brilliant manifesto ( so brilliant that I voted for it ) but its share of the 2014 Party Vote was a demoralising 1.42 percent .\\nIn other words , if all the “ current and future renters ” had voted for Internet-Mana in 2014 , its ideological and political influence would have made the Covid-19 response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months unthinkable .\\nAnd that ’ s what I mean by statistics shorn of context not amounting to very much .\\nFor the only people who counted – the people who voted – Jacinda Ardern ’ s and Grant Robertson ’ s Covid response was good enough to see them returned to office with 50 percent of the Party Vote .\\nThat Mr Hickey should be surprised that the values of politicians tend to reflect the values of their supporters is , itself , surprising .\\nIf he wants a revolution , Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excoriate Labour and the Greens on Substack – he ’ ll need to organise one .',\n",

       "  'content': 'WHAT IS LABOUR going to do about Efeso Collins ?\\nHis decision to offer himself as a candidate in this year ’ s Auckland mayoral election places the party in a very difficult position .\\nIf Labour backs him , he risks dragging it in a direction it doesn ’ t want to go .\\nIf it sacks him , he just might win anyway .\\nCollins is a larger than life politician of considerable eloquence and unsettling ( for Labour ’ s top brass ) independence of mind .\\nEven worse , he is a politician unafraid to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of angering his senior colleagues .\\nBorn and raised in Otara , the youngest son of Samoan immigrants , Collins possesses that rare , but highly prized , quality of personal authenticity .\\nFor the Pasifika community , he ’ s the Man .\\nIn other words , Collins promises to be the sort of candidate who can generate genuine excitement among an electorate that usually dismisses local government elections as too boring to bother with .\\nThat said , you might think that Labour ’ s top brass would have fallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God for sending us a candidate straight out of Central Casting !\\n” But they ’ re didn ’ t .\\nWhy ?\\nBecause Collins makes them look like the stale , white-bread , don ’ t-rock-the-boat politicians that they truly are – and they hate him for it .\\nFoolishly , Labour ’ s top brass have allowed their animosity towards Collins to cloud their strategic political judgement .\\nWithout first securing a rock-solid guarantee from Collins that he was not going to run , they started briefing the Auckland news media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon as Phil Goff ’ s replacement .\\n( That Phil Goff had fixed upon the same man made it all too easy ! )\\nNorth Shore councillor , Richard Hills , was presented as the man upon whom Labour ’ s hands had been laid .\\nTechnocratic , socially liberal , a disciple of the gospel of “ governance ” , and a bona fide policy wonk , Hills was shopped around to local government journalists as Labour ’ s heir presumptive to the mayoral chains .\\nAnd then Collins announced – @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no less .\\nIn a long interview with Spinoff editor , Toby Manhire , Collins laid out his pitch for “ the second most powerful job in New Zealand ” .\\nIt was a damn good pitch , confirming just how adroit Collins has become at presenting himself as both a genuine reformer and a moral conservative – the perfect South Auckland combo , but also one likely to kindle genuine interest among a great many more Aucklanders than simply the city ’ s Pasifika population .\\nReceiving the near instant endorsement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was proof of Collins considerable cross-over appeal .\\nThe Spinoff also did Collins the enormous favour of putting up a video produced by his South Auckland supporters for his first run at local office .\\nThis is the sort of thing that Labour ’ s pathologically cautious apparatchiks just can ’ t do .\\nJacinda can – which is why Labour is where it is today .\\nDo what ?\\nMake her party look cool-as .\\nWhat The Spinoff allowed its huge audience of young , politically engaged readers to see and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mastered this style of communication , Efeso ’ s campaign workers had nailed it to the wall .\\nThis is Labour ’ s problem .\\nIt has set its heart on a Hilary Clinton , who can ’ t win , and is now facing a Barack Obama , who can .\\nWhat to do ?\\nThe most obvious solution – which Collins admits to lobbying for hard over many months to no avail – is an open process of democratic selection .\\nA “ primary ” , if you will , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their parties ’ choices .\\nLabour Party members , across the whole of Auckland City , would be asked to vote for their preferred candidate .\\nSimple ?\\nEffective ?\\nYou might think so .\\nBut , Labour ’ s top brass hate the whole idea of membership elections .\\n( Mention the name of David Cunliffe and watch them turn pale ! )\\nThe only election process they seem to favour is something along the lines of the College of Cardinals choosing a Pope .\\nAn entirely mysterious process , conducted behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nBesides , even if the Labour top brass could be persuaded to democratise the selection process , they ’ d still be faced with the problem that Collins would , almost certainly , win it .\\nAnd if he did , he would likely prove even less amenable to the guidance of Labour ’ s top brass than he has as a humble councillor .\\nLike his last-minute refusal to vote for Goff ’ s regional fuel tax , arguing convincingly that it would disproportionately impact his Pasifika and Māori constituents who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get them to work on time .\\nNot the sort of argument that cut much ice with North Shore Councillor Richard Hills – who loyally supported Mayor Goff ’ s regressive policy .\\nSo , what will Labour do ?\\nMy best guess is they will put Hills up as an “ independent ” candidate and spend the whole campaign casting Collins in the role of “ spoiler ” and “ splitter ” of the “ centre-left ” vote .\\nIf that fails to produce the desired effect in the polls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will remind voters that Collin ’ s opposed gay marriage and has personal moral objections to abortion .\\nThoroughly distancing themselves from such scurrilous tactics , Labour will , nevertheless , be privately delighted to see their “ friends ” in the news media amplify these attempts to cancel Collins ’ campaign .\\nWill it work ?\\nDoubtful .\\nWokeness is an acquired socio-political taste – at best .\\nDepending on how Collins responds to these attacks , his standing with the average , non-woke , voter could even be enhanced .\\nA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under attack by the worst elements of “ progressive ” left-wing culture .\\nWhat ’ s not to like ?\\nThen , of course , there ’ s the Right .\\nShould its preferred mayoral candidate/s fail to fire , and the race between Collins and Hills come down to the wire , conservative Aucklanders could easily decide to inflict a crushing blow upon Labour in Auckland by throwing their weight behind Collins – thereby ensuring his victory , as well as giving themselves a not insignificant role in the election of Auckland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optimistic ?\\nMaybe .\\nBut just read this extract from Collins interview with The Spinoff before writing-off the chances of the Right swinging in behind him : “ As far as reaching across the left-right aisle is concerned , Collins points to his working relationship with Desley Simpson , the National-aligned councillor for Ōrākei .\\n“ I made a deliberate choice to sit next to Desley .\\nAnd that is based on the fact that I represent the poorest ward in the city , and she represents the wealthiest , and we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on and thrash things out , ” he says .\\n“ And what that has done has allowed me to understand how people in her area see the world , the same way I can invite her to understand how our people in this part of Auckland see the world.\\n” During last year ’ s Covid lockdown , that resulted in “ one of those beautiful things ” , he says , when “ she turned up with trailer loads of goods , which had women ’ s sanitary products , food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Māngere budgeting service – trailer loads of stuff … She rang me and said : “ Look , I ’ ve got these people who said they ’ ve seen you on TV , they know you ’ re really keen to get some services and products out to your community .\\nLet ’ s make the link.\\n” It ’ s stories like that which make Efeso Collins such a formidable mayoral candidate .\\nRaised on Bible stories , he knows how to craft a memorable parable .\\nLabour ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mine once observed of another ideologically rigid organisation , is that : “ They ’ d rather keep control of the losing side than lose control of the winning side.\\n” Well , faced with Efeso Collins , the chances of Labour keeping control of the Auckland mayoralty strike me as slim .\\nI think they ’ ll lose it .\\nAnd , frankly , that will be no bad thing .',\n",

       "  'content': 'A MATE OF MINE sent me an e-mail .\\n“ I guess no one told Phil Twyford about Ali Baba.\\n” I followed the link to an advertisement for kitset homes manufactured in China .\\nYou could have one of these : completely broken down and shipped to your nearest port in a container ; for approximately $ NZ15,000 .\\nThe quality of the home I can not vouch for , but that really isn ’ t the point , is it ?\\nIf this Government had possessed the courage to , just once , think outside the square , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be over .\\nBy negotiating a deal with the Chinese , whereby cheap kitset homes were shipped to New Zealand at a fraction of the cost of building a similar house here , the social and economic problems attributable to the lack of low-cost housing could have been tackled head-on .\\nThe potential problems associated with the quality of these kitset homes could easily have been addressed at a government-to-government level .\\nGiven the enormous pay-off for Beijing , the durability and weatherproofness of such dwellings could be guaranteed .\\nWith the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infrastructure , whole towns could have sprung up out of the ground with astonishing speed – as they once did in the days when New Zealand still possessed a Ministry of Works .\\nJust think of the economic and social impact of being able to supply a warm , dry , and healthy home for every family in need of one .\\nThe satisfaction of this need would , obviously , have reduced property speculation dramatically and kept private-sector rents low .\\nIn response , investment would have been re-directed away from real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the economy .\\nWelcome as these effects might be , they would pale into insignificance when compared to the improvement universal housing would bring to New Zealand ’ s rapidly declining social indicators .\\nThe educational performance of New Zealand ’ s poorest children would improve rapidly once their parents were safely and securely housed .\\nNothing retards a child ’ s educational attainment like being forced to move frequently from house to house and school to school .\\nThe elimination of serious overcrowding would also eliminate a broad range of the physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many people living in too little space .\\nDomestic violence , too , would reduce dramatically .\\nSolving the housing crisis would reveal to every New Zealander just how many of the country ’ s other problems are the direct result of widespread homelessness and unrelenting housing insecurity .\\nThe problem , of course , is that even if this government ’ s first housing minister , Phil Twyford , had been made aware of the capacity of the Chinese construction industry to meet the demand for cheap public housing , he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ host of obstacles .\\nObviously , New Zealand ’ s domestic construction industry would have screamed blue-bloody-murder at the price-depressing effects of such formidable foreign competition .\\nThe seriously disrupted relationship between local government , land-bankers and builders would , similarly , have provoked loud protests .\\nThe most ear-splitting shrieks , however , would have come from landlords .\\nOvernight , their business model would have collapsed – along with their ability to ruthlessly immiserate their tenants by constantly ratcheting-up rents .\\nOwning multiple properties would no longer make commercial sense .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ be put up for sale in what would very soon become a buyers ’ market .\\nWhat had been a crippling shortage of affordable housing would suddenly become a glut .\\nPrices would tumble , and the dream of home-ownership for middle-class thirty-somethings would be realised .\\nAs this cascade of consequences descended upon the New Zealand economy , homeowners would watch with mounting horror as the putative value of their houses declined precipitously .\\nThe powerful sense of well-being engendered by the seemingly unstoppable rise of house prices , sweetened by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax-free capital gains when they eventually sold-up and moved to the provinces , would evaporate in a red mist of anger and resentment .\\nExposed , in all its ugly reality , would be the naked class interests bound up in the maintenance of the housing crisis .\\nBy freeing the working-poor and beneficiaries from the misery of housing insecurity and homelessness , the Deus ex machina of cheap Chinese kitset homes , purchased with cheap Chinese credit , would have produced a profound re-ordering of class relations .\\nThe 60 percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winning side of the housing crisis would not have been best pleased .\\nTo strategic onlookers located in Washington , London and Canberra , such a sudden reversal of class fortunes , especially one made possible by the shrewd intervention of Beijing , would ’ ve been utterly unacceptable .\\nAs disturbing to our “ allies ” as it was to those on the deal ’ s domestic downside .\\nThe very idea of the New Zealand working-class clasping with relief and gratitude the helping hand offered to them by a courageous Labour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would give New Zealand ’ s Five Eyes partners the screaming heebie-jeebies .\\nIn the time it takes to “ make the economy scream ” , Jacinda Ardern would ’ ve found herself walking the same path as Salvador Allende .\\nThe problem is not that New Zealand ’ s housing crisis can not be fixed , but that it is not in the unequivocal material interest of enough New Zealanders to allow it to be fixed – not even at Ali Baba ’ s knock-down price of $ 15,000 per unit @',\n",

       "  'content': 'THE ADVOCATES OF CO-GOVERNANCE clearly believe it to be an idea whose hour has come .\\nBut , such is the temper of the times New Zealanders are living through , that co-governance is not an idea which has had to withstand very much in the way of serious interrogation .\\nGiven its potential to divide the New Zealand population , this is not only unfortunate , but also bears grim witness to this country ’ s intellectual timidity .\\nAn idea that could tear this country apart surely merits much closer examination ?\\nSuch an examination can not proceed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumption .\\nThe Treaty of Waitangi must be accepted – in the face of overwhelming contemporary evidence to the contrary – as a “ partnership ” between the British Crown and the tangata whenua of “ Aotearoa ” .\\nThis is crucial .\\nIf the Treaty was not a document dedicated to the principle of partnership , then it can not also be a document mandating the co-governance of New Zealand .\\nCo-governance is being presented to us as the constitutional and political expression of “ the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted for nearly a century-and-a-half , the Treaty simply documents its signatories ’ voluntary cession of sovereignty to the British Crown ; the latter ’ s reciprocal pledge to respect both the materially and culturally sustaining resources of the indigenous communities ; and the Crown ’ s granting to these communities of the full and equal protection of British Law – then its “ principles ” encompass no more than the unambiguous transfer of power from a weaker party to a stronger .\\nObviously , it is impossible to extract co-governance from such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only if the Treaty itself is held to encompass something entirely different .\\nBut this assumption does not make things any easier .\\nIf the signatories to the Treaty truly believed that it made them co-governors of New Zealand , alongside the official representatives and subjects of Queen Victoria , then the subsequent development of co-governance is fraught with difficulties and dangers .\\nTwelve years after the signing of the Treaty , when their numbers were roughly co-equal with those of the Māori , the subjects of Queen Victoria – manfully assisted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantial measure of self-government .\\nIt did not take the Māori tribes very long to work out that they were constitutionally subsumed within this devolution of Royal authority .\\nBluntly , the Pakeha settlers believed themselves empowered to rule not only themselves , but Māori too .\\nThe idea of co-governance ( assuming it had ever existed at all ) seemed to have melted away like the morning mist .\\nIt is possible , of course , to construe the history of the decade following the granting of self-government in 1853 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government and the Māori tribes living in the territory immediately south of Auckland in 1863 , as an attempt to construct a political vehicle capable of embedding the concept of co-governance in New Zealand ’ s nascent constitutional arrangements .\\nThe attempt to create a Māori monarchy – the Kingitanga – made this desire for co-governance explicit .\\nBut the fate of the King Movement : military defeat and occupation , and the forfeiture of the participating tribes ’ lands , forests and fisheries ; makes it crystal clear what the colonial authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , did the British Government , whose dispatch of more than 10,000 imperial troops , to enforce the will of the colonists , made the overpowering of the Māori proponents of co-governance inevitable .\\nExposed in the course of the New Zealand Wars was the brutal political reality that , as the Romans discovered , there can be only one emperor in the empire .\\nDuumvirs have a nasty habit of being reduced to single figures .\\nAs the heroes of the movie Highlander were fond of saying : “ There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example of the 1850s and 60s in front of them , the proponents of co-governance in twenty-first century New Zealand should have no illusions about what lies ahead if the concept acquires the political solidity of the Kingitanga prior to General Cameron ’ s arrival .\\nAnd , thanks to the historical ignorance and constitutional naivety of the Sixth Labour Government , it is acquiring political solidity – with astonishing speed .\\nBut , as co-governance becomes entrenched constitutionally , in the same way the ideas of the British settlers concerning the nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 1850s , then its proponents need to be very clear about what is likely to happen next .\\nThe descendants of the settlers , and the inheritors of their colonial institutions – which includes the democratic political system itself – will , like the Māori before them , do all within their power to preserve the material and cultural properties by which they and their ancestors were , and are , uplifted and sustained .\\nIn other words , they will fight .\\nThere really is no other way the co-governance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispassionate historian can not avoid the conclusion that the settler government , adamant that it would not share power with the Māori , set out to provoke and prosecute a war of conquest against the only concentration of indigenous political , economic and military strength remotely capable of thwarting its plans to build a “ Better Britain ” , the Kingitanga ; it is equally impossible to avoid the conclusion that those elements of the political class , academia , the judiciary , the bureaucracy and the news media ; all the allies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neo-tribal capitalists they serve ; are equally aware that their plans to restore “ Aotearoa ” can only be imposed by dismantling “ New Zealand ” – and subduing all who still believe in her .\\nThe proponents of co-governance have no genuine intention of sharing power with those who refuse to accept their understanding of the Treaty of Waitangi .\\nTheir purpose is the same as the Crown ’ s and the settlers ’ armies that invaded the Waikato in 1863 : to wield power .',\n",

when has it ever not been so , and where has it all actually gotten us ?\\nOf the countless social equity debates that have gone on since forever , few seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writers ’ gets some dirty water off their chests and readers get to argue what ’ s potable .\\nAnd still we ’ re no closer to Nirvana .\\nThe one thing that would make the sea-change that ’ s needed , and on which we can all agree , still eludes us .\\nFor all our supposed sophistication , we remain locked into the boom-bust cycle that bedevils all Capitalist economies , with no end in sight .\\nUbiquitous to the Capitalist system , and at the core of the problem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society ’ s improved living standards , to afford the ever-increasing cost of the progress their endeavours produce .\\nAnd critical to that conundrum is land .\\nCapitalism is a system that “ capitalises ” on improving living standards by producing more products to absorb the surplus , which , to work , requires more land on which to build the enterprises producing the new goods .\\nAnd inevitably this is where speculators , “ banking ” on the inevitability of that progress , buy up the land in advance of the progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it happens , but thereby pushing up the price of all land as a consequence .\\nOur system of Capitalism requires that those whose labours produce the progress , must then buy the bounty of their own sweat – the increased value of land – just to maintain Capitalism ’ s momentum .\\nAnd so we get the crazy house/land price situation we ’ re in right now .\\nProducing not one iota of productive enterprise , land-banking or land speculation , is not entrepreneurial Capitalism at work , but just venal opportunism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gross waste of capital that could be used to fund job/wealth creation , it fuels a ballooning social equity imbalance , such as we ‘ re currently experiencing , which ultimately produces the boom/bust cycle that plagues us !\\nThat ’ s not right – that ’ s not kind – that ’ s crazy !\\nThe good news is the answer to the problem was solved 150 years ago .\\nAnd , because speculators are not Capitalists , but “ venal opportunists , ” we don ’ t have to take “ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to embrace it .\\nThis might be a good time to suggest that nobody is more acutely aware of the part land plays in the securing and maintenance of community prosperity , than Maori .\\nMaori had no concept of private ownership of land , which to them , since , you couldn ’ t physically take it home , made no sense and was just silly .\\nIn Maori society land was/is regarded as a communal good and its development , like establishing a pah site or a vegetable garden , was/is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone profited .\\nAnd haven ’ t they paid a price for their naivety .\\nColonial governments treated the purchase of land from Maori as a cash cow they could milk as they on-sold it to new immigrants , to fund yet more immigration .\\nAnd so land values increased exponentially , and totally out of all proportion to the price paid for it .\\nThe price paid Maori for land was never fair .\\nThe very act of its transfer from a communal system to a Capitalist system immediately changed its value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penny dropped , literally , Maori went to war .\\nAnd so should we now !\\nJust as Maori , in recognition of the material and social harm done to them , had huge areas of land returned , so we too should demand that the land which our endeavours have made flower , be returned to common ownership , or some equivalent .\\nAnd before you dismiss such an idea as Utopian navel gazing , it ’ s something we already do , but only in the public sector .\\nWe build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on land we don ’ t have to buy because we already own it in common .\\nBut if the land was owned by speculators , the cost of those developments would be prohibitive – like the cost of houses today !\\nAll of which brings me to American economist and social thinker Henry George , and the book he wrote on the subject , “ Progress and Poverty ” which at the time of its publication exceeded the sale of all other books but the bible .\\nWikipedia describes “ Progress and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the questions of why poverty accompanies economic and technological progress and why economies exhibit a tendency toward cyclical boom and bust.\\n” in which ; “ George uses history and deductive logic to argue for a radical solution focusing on the capture of economic rent from natural resources and land titles.\\n” “ Progress and Poverty ” helped spark the Progressive Era and a worldwide social reform movement around an ideology now known as ‘ Georgism ‘ .\\nDanish-American social reformer Jacob Riis , for example , explicitly marks the beginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it coincides with the date of Henry George ’ s book .\\n[ Wikipedia records that Progress and Poverty had perhaps even a larger impact around the world , in places such as Denmark , the United Kingdom , Australia , and New Zealand , where George ’ s influence was enormous .\\n[ 4 ] Contemporary sources and historians claim that in the United Kingdom , a vast majority of both socialist and classical liberal activists could trace their ideological development to Henry George .\\nAnd George ’ s popularity was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1906 , a survey of British parliamentarians revealed that the American author ’ s writing was more popular than Walter Scott , John Stuart Mill , and William Shakespeare .\\n[ 5 ] In 1933 , John Dewey estimated that Progress and Poverty “ had a wider distribution than almost all other books on political economy put together.\\n” And over the years the idea of taxing land , as a political policy , has attracted supporters from across the political spectrum , from Winston Churchill and Milton Friedman to Clarence Darrow .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry George ’ s ideas are ever as simple as might be imagined .\\nBut it is significant that in March 2015 , the Obama administration discussed them in a Bloomberg op-ed titled “ To Fight Inequality , Tax Land , ” which was followed by a similar piece in The Economist titled ’ “ Why Henry George Had a Point ” – the case for making landowners pay for the benefits which location gives them .\\nAnd both articles sprang from a paper given by Joseph Stiglitz , the Nobel Prize–winning economist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There – I ’ m glad I ’ ve got that off my chest .',\n",

       "  'content': 'The most important understanding Aotearoa New Zealand should take from our current reality is that the big majority of Māori whanau are worse off today than they were before the fourth Labour government gave the power to the Waitangi Tribunal to begin investigating historic breaches of the Treaty in the 1980s .\\nThe reason Māori are worse off now is because the working class is worse off , and Māori are disproportionately in the working class .\\nThe working class are always the shock absorbers in the economy and Māori are therefore always disproportionately impacted .\\nIn the same breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Treaty the David Lange/Roger Douglas government unleashed a raft of economic changes which stripped away protections for families and communities and gutted the welfare state .\\nIn alliance with the rich they , and the National government which followed them , smashed the unions and drove hundreds of thousands of working New Zealanders into poverty .\\nIt was classic class warfare and the rich won and are still winning all the way to a country whose defining identity is poverty and inequality .\\nThe total paid out in treaty settlements since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now just over $ 2 billion .\\nIt represents less than three percent of the value of land and assets stolen from Māori .\\n( The last of the big settlements , the largest in fact , will be with Ngapuhi which is yet to start negotiations ) And for useful comparison , never forget that John Key ’ s National cabinet , after a 10-minute discussion around the cabinet table , agreed to pay up to $ 1.7 billion to the wealthy investors in the collapsed South Canterbury Finance .\\nNot a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed over to Māori from the government without iwi being required to set up capitalist structures to receive and administer it as part of our capitalist economy .\\nThis was a vital pre-condition .\\nThe resulting tensions within iwi are palpable and the ironies abound .\\nMost Māori would never dream of sending their elders into a rest home but Ngai Tahu has done very well from its holdings in Ryman Healthcare which farms the elderly for their life savings and government subsidies .\\nIwi leaders are no different from traditional capitalists in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Māori whanau is not much and neither should it be expected to be much .\\nMost iwi are able to distribute some education scholarships and offer a small range of payouts and benefits but these will never be able to make a significant difference in the daily lives of most Māori .\\nAnd Māori who are not connected with their iwi are out in the cold altogether .\\nIwi leaders – the heads of these capitalist enterprises – have become the group governments like to consult with .\\nJohn Key was notorious for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much different .\\nAotearoa New Zealand is feeling its way forward in developing a more respectful and honourable relationship between Pākehā and Māori with the Treaty as the stake in the ground – a critical reference point .\\nThere are some positive examples emerging , not just through guaranteed Māori representation in local government , but in areas such as management of Te Urewera and innovative models such as that proposed to deal with water after capitalist exploitation of fresh water has brought us to crisis point .\\nNone of these innovations is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of scaremongering by some farmers and the predictable ACT/Brash brigade .\\nHandled well and led well the public will see these are enhancements of democracy – bring the 15 % Māori populations into the democratic tent .\\nUnfortunately , no-one in the current government , aside from Nanaia Mahuta and David Parker to some extent , are prepared to front foot and drive meaningful change .\\nThe most likely result on water will be that significant water reforms are abandoned in much the same way Ardern threw in the towel without a fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most critical issues facing Māori and the working class in 2022 are housing and taxation : The latest figures to September 2021 give the state house waiting list as 24,546 with half of that number being Māori whanau .\\nThis Labour government has been building state houses at less than twice the rate the state house waiting list has been increasing .\\nThis is great for middle-class landlords who can continue to charge impossible rents , knowing the government will continue paying them an extra $ 2 billion each year in accommodation supplements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign this year will be built around the central demand the government build state houses for desperate families – disproportionately Māori .\\nIf you haven ’ t signed this petition to help get the ball rolling then don ’ t pretend you care about housing .\\nMāori pay higher tax rates than Pākehā .\\nThis is because the working class pay the highest tax rates and again because Māori are disproportionately in the working class they , on average , pay higher rates of tax when GST and income tax are considered together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poor .\\nWorkers are hammered because they have to spend all their income while the middle class and the rich can save some and therefore lose less in GST .\\n( The lowest income 10 % pay 14 % of their income in GST while the top 10 % pay less than 5 % of their income in GST ) Unlike the middle class and the wealthy , workers pay tax on every dollar they earn and every dollar they spend .\\nThere will be significant campaigning around tax this year and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be prepared to pitch in and help .\\nWhat will make a difference for Māori and the working class in 2022 : If campaigns on housing and tax can get off the ground and gain momentum they will force Labour to act and implement radical change .\\nIt won ’ t be easy .\\nLabour are wedded to what their middle class focus groups are saying – in fact they are joined at the hip to the corporate and the comfortable .\\nIt is only radical action which will force their hand for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your bit in these campaigns in 2022 .\\nWe have to be serious – this is a crisis for Māori and workers – only radical solutions driven by active campaigning will make any difference .\\nSee you on the streets in 2022 .',\n",

       "  'content': 'In response to a reporter asking why the government had demolished more state houses than it built in the past six months the government blamed lockdowns and supply chain issues and the PM said : “ One of the main priorities of this government has been when we came into office and were facing a housing crisis where the last national government had continuously sold off our state housing was to rebuild our public housing stock and we have done that at an incredible rate ” It ’ s “ incredible ” – yes – but not in the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are : • Despite four years of Labour-led governments , the number of state house rentals available has remained largely static ( 2016 – 67,041 rentals ; 2021 – 67,858 ) while the state house waiting list has soared from 5,000 to 24,546 with half of that number being Māori whanau .\\n• The present government has continued the previous governments budget of funding additional social places at 1600 per year despite the fact the waiting list had exploded .\\n• The government is committed to keeping state housing at 3.6 % of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % of total housing stock it was in 1990 .\\nThe government has no plans to change this despite the massive housing crisis for low-income tenants and families .\\n• In his evidence to the Waitangi Tribunal in mid 2021 ( Wai 2750 ) Kainga Ora CEO Andrew McKenzie says the organisation has an “ ambitious programme ” over the next four years which will provide a net increase of 8,200 state houses .\\nProviding 2050 additional state houses each year for a waiting list of 24 , 546 can only be described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andrew McKenzie confirmed that when the Labour led Government came to power in 2017 officials recommended that the previous Government ’ s public housing budget be increased so state house building would increase from 1600 to 2000 a year but , astonishingly , the Labour-led government said NO and is still sticking to National ’ s plan despite the explosion in the waiting list .\\n• The government ’ s long-term plan , according to Kainga Ora ’ s current Long-Term Plan , is to add 23,000 additional places over 30 years .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 30 years time !\\nAndrew McKenzie explained to the Waitangi Tribunal that the ability of Kainga Ora to further expand supply is limited by Kainga Ora having to fund additional housing out of its own resources and borrowings .\\n• This means it is only by selling land can Kainga Ora build even the modest number it is building now .\\nKainga Ora is therefore involved in large-scale privatisation of crown land for private sector housebuilding – on former state-house land – while the state house waiting list and the misery of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ • Social housing providers are NOT the answer .\\nThese are niche providers who can never deliver the scale of housebuilding needed to meet this crisis for those on low-incomes .\\n• We desperately need a stand-alone government agency which embarks on an industrial scale state house building programme which uses lower borrowing rates for the government , economies of scale , crown and local body land and fast-tracking planning , design and building .\\n• Taking this approach in the late 1930s the first Labour government was building 3,500 state houses per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be 10,000 per year .\\nThe government has built – 5 ( minus five ) over the past six months .\\n• An industrial scale state house building programme would save billions through reducing the massive spending on motels ( over $ 300 million per year ) and in accommodation supplements ( over $ 1.7 billion per year ) These subsidies to private sector landlords are “ dead money ” .\\nThe State House Building Coalition has begun a campaign to force the government to change its policy .\\nThe second step of @ @ @ @ @ @ @',\n",

       "  'content': 'his article from The Economist is a bit difficult to extract the central facts from or understand their significance .\\nSo , here are the highlights in italics and I will try and explain the significance afterward : In such a scenario , the interest bill would exceed $ 16trn by 2026 , equivalent to 15 % of projected GDP in that year .\\nAnd if rates were to rise twice as quickly , say because inflation persists and forces central banks to take drastic action , the interest bill could rise to about $ 20trn by 2026 , nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the potential scale of the increase , we consider a scenario where the interest rates faced by firms , households and governments rise by a percentage point over the next three years .\\nThe scale of the global interest bill is vast .\\nThe Economist estimates that households , companies , financial firms and governments worldwide paid around $ 10.5trn in interest costs in 2021 , equivalent to 12 % of GDP .\\nAll this could soon change .\\nThe era of super-cheap money is ending .\\nCentral banks are battling a surge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though global debt has rocketed over the years , the world ’ s interest costs , as a share of GDP , are well below their peak in the 1980s .\\nPart of the reason for this explosion has been the steady decline in borrowing costs over the past two decades .\\nNEVER BEFORE has the world economy been so indebted .\\nThe stock of global debt has gone from $ 83trn in 2000 to around $ 295trn in 2021—a rate nearly double the pace of world GDP growth .\\nDebt rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 320 % on the eve of the pandemic , before covid-19 propelled it to the even greater height of 355 % last year .\\nLook at this graph the percentage of US companies that have failed to make enough money over the last three years to service the interest on their current debt .\\nThey are dubbed “ zombie firms ” and now make up 20 % of the total compared to almost nothing in 2008 .\\nWhat will happen when they face a major increase in interest rates as well .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 1-2 % because of the risk they already pose .\\nThis percentage increase is a very likely development .\\nThe inevitable result will be a domino of crashes – beginning with the most indebted countries and companies .\\nEconomists William Rhodes and John Lipsky , who lead the Sovereign Debt Working Group at the Bretton Woods Committee—a semi-official US economic think tank—wrote in the Wall Street Journal this week about growing “ challenges ” in the sovereign debt market .\\n“ The warning signs of a crisis are already clear , ” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monetary Fund figures , interest payments on public debt as a percentage of public revenues are four times as high in low-income countries as in advanced economies , while the same ratio in emerging economies is twice as high.\\n” A decade ago this ratio was similar across all countries , but today , according to the World Bank , some “ 60 percent of low-income countries are either suffering from debt distress or at high risk of doing so.\\n” The day of reckoning has been postponed again and again by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the world since the crisis of 2008 .\\nThe debt and money creation kept pumping and pumping .\\nWorldwide inflation means that must end .\\nInflation is now averaging 7 % across the globe .\\nThis is entirely a central bank-created problem .\\nThis is not something to do with Covid-induced supply problems .\\nInflation hurts working people by reducing real wages unless we fight very hard to keep up .\\nHowever , inflation is a also process whereby debt is being radically reduced in value .\\nThe 1 % rely on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enrich themselves fabulously .\\nThey will not allow inflation to continue and reduce its real value .\\nBut their only tool to kill inflation is to reduce the money supply by reducing credit and increasing interest rates .\\nKeynesian economists don ’ t understand this .\\nThey mistakenly see inflation as a cost-plus problem and blame inflation on wage increases or oil price rises similarly to what they did in the 1970s .\\nThey were wrong then and the US dollar suffered a radical devaluation against gold that threatened hyperinflation before control was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shock in 1979 – a US Fed interest rate of 20 % .\\nMortgage rates and other debt rates followed .\\nMutli-year US recessions and economic contractions around the world followed as did the Third W # orld debt crisis given all debts were denominated in US dollars .\\nKeynesians lost control to the monetarist followers of Milton Friedman following that inflationary crisis of the 1970s .\\nInflation was never meant to exceed 2 % and we were supposed to trust them to do that .\\nMonetarism was in turn abandoned in 2008 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a depression and Interest rares were driven to historic lows , money was printed and handed to the 1 % to settle debts between themselves .\\nThe same course was adopted in late 2019 when a new recession threatened .\\nBut Covid forced the government ’ s and central banks to not only give to the 1 % but to ensure working people had incomes to support themselves during the crisis .\\nThis meant budget deficits and monetary creation that wasn ’ t just for the 1 % .\\nIt was this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nThe requirement to increase interest rates and cut back on the money already in the system to end inflation will also bring an abrupt end to what has been drubbed a “ superbubble ” in the US economy .\\nToday in the U.S. we are in the fourth superbubble of the last hundred years .\\nPrevious equity superbubbles had a series of distinct features that individually are rare and collectively are unique to these events .\\nIn each case , these shared characteristics have already occurred in this cycle .\\nThe penultimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the rate of price advance to two or three times the average speed of the full bull market .\\nIn this cycle , the acceleration occurred in 2020 and ended in February 2021 , during which time the NASDAQ rose 58 % measured from the end of 2019 ( and an astonishing 105 % from the Covid-19 low ! )\\n.\\nThe final feature of the great superbubbles has been a sustained narrowing of the market and unique underperformance of speculative stocks , many of which fall as the blue chip market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2000 , and it is occurring now .\\nA plausible reason for this effect would be that experienced professionals who know that the market is dangerously overpriced yet feel for commercial reasons they must keep dancing prefer at least to dance off the cliff with safer stocks .\\nThis is why at the end of the great bubbles it seems as if the confidence termites attack the most speculative and vulnerable first and work their way up , sometimes quite slowly , to the blue chips .\\nThe most important and hardest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in the touchy-feely characteristic of crazy investor behavior .\\nBut in the last two and a half years there can surely be no doubt that we have seen crazy investor behavior in spades – more even than in 2000 – especially in meme stocks and in EV-related stocks , in cryptocurrencies , and in NFTs .\\nThis checklist for a superbubble running through its phases is now complete and the wild rumpus can begin at any time .\\nThis means a market crash with a prolonged loss of value in sharemarkets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time .\\nThe crisis seems unavoidable and working people need to prepare .\\nThe wild swings of value of tech stock on Wall Street last week are a portent of what is to come and was highlighted by the Facebook parent company meta losing 26.4 % in value in a single day , equal to $ 230 billion in value , the biggest loss by a company in history .\\nUnfortunately for the working class , we have no stake in either monetary theory used to maintain capitalism .\\nWe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken system .\\nWe need to take the economic power being kept in the hands of the 1 % out of their hands .\\nThat means making all money and its creation a public service .\\nThat means the banks , pension funds , insurance companies have to be nationalised and placed under democratic control and planning .\\nThe 1 % have to be expropriated and the economy made to meet human needs and not be forced to only serve private profit and greed .',\n",

.\\nTo date , however , the te Tiriti-driven policies and plans of all three left-wing parties offer no opportunity for the people of New Zealand to have their say on the profound constitutional changes being promoted .\\nThe Left ’ s refusal to abide by the long-established conventions for validating and effecting significant constitutional change in New Zealand will leave them wide open to the charge that they are conspiring to brush aside their country ’ s democratic traditions .\\nThe most damaging aspect of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is true .\\nThe te Tiriti-driven constitutional transformation proposed by the parties of the Left makes no provision for popular ratification .\\nThe radical changes proposed – like Three Waters – will either be imposed by statute , or achieved by

political game .\\nThe convention that significant constitutional reform – like altering the way parliamentarians are elected – @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will simply be over-ridden .\\nLabour and the Greens have “ form ” in this regard .\\nThe Labour-led government of Helen Clark established the New Zealand Supreme Court and abolished the right of New Zealanders to appeal to the Privy Council in London by simply passing a law to that effect .\\nIn spite of the radical reformation of the New Zealand judiciary proposed by the law ’ s supporters , New Zealanders were given no opportunity to vote the

role of the Privy Council .\\nIn December 2000 Cabinet approved the release of a discussion paper entitled Reshaping New Zealand ’ s Appeal Structure .\\nIt invited public comment on three options to

of a Supreme Court Bill .\\nThe bill was introduced in 2002 , and passed by Parliament on 14 October 2003 .\\nThe Act came into force on 1 January 2004 , officially establishing the Supreme Court , and at the same time ending appeals to the Privy Council in relation to all decisions of New Zealand courts made after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : A “ discussion paper ” is released .\\nPublic “ comment ” is invited .\\nIn spite of expert opinion being “ evenly divided ” , “ further public consultation ” takes place .\\nEventually , a “ Ministerial Advisory Group ” presents a report .\\nThis report

from four of the seven parties represented in Parliament , the call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill passes , 63 votes ( Labour , Greens , Progressives ) in favour , 57 votes ( National , NZ First , Act , United

precinct of protesters , remove their tents and Portaloos , tow away the cars and trucks blocking the streets of central Wellington ?\\nOr , are the tactics deployed more concerned with the “ look ” of the operation .\\nIs the objective to show New Zealand how very different our modern Police Force is from the baton-wielding riot squads of forty years ago ?\\nIf it was the “ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they certainly achieved their objective .\\nPolice commanders in other jurisdictions , watching the live feeds from New Zealand on their computers , must have shaken their heads in disbelief .\\nConstables in their shirtsleeves , unhelmeted , inadequately masked against a crowd of unvaccinated citizens , and deployed in numbers insufficient to enforce the law effectively , were being asked to confront a defiant crowd of several hundred .\\nThe tactic , referred to by the Wellington District Commander , Corrie Parnell , as a “ graduated response ” , seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and herding them out of Parliament Grounds and into the street .\\nThis was to be done without the use of any of the crowd control equipment available to officers overseas .\\nThere were to be no shields , no pepper spray , no tasers , no batons , no tear gas , no rubber bullets .\\nArrests were permissible , but since it required at least two – usually four – police officers to subdue each protester , cuff them , and lead them away , it was soon apparent that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the crowd quickly .\\nIndeed , hours went by , and the number of protesters remained fairly constant .\\nThis inability of the Police to make any serious impression on either the size , or the intentions , of the crowd , combined with the public ’ s awareness of the infection risk posed to the constables on the front line , very soon altered the “ look ” of the Police operation dramatically .\\nFar from being impressed by the restraint of the Police , those watching the live feeds began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utter ineffectuality of the tactics being employed .\\nThe Police commanders seemed paralysed .\\nUnable to withdraw , but unwilling to deploy either the numbers , or the crowd control measures , needed to bring the protest to a close .\\nAll that the public saw was a crowd of anti-vaxxers successfully defying a New Zealand Police Force that either could not , or would not , compel them to disperse .\\nThe message conveyed was not of a restrained , compassionate – but effective – Police Force .\\nAll the New Zealand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A state may be defined as a set of institutions with a monopoly over the exercise of political control – a monopoly made possible by its exclusive access to the means of organised violence .\\nNo state can afford to allow its citizens to gain the impression that it lacks either the means , or the will , to deploy violence against those who defy it .\\nWhy ?\\nBecause those who look to the state ’ s “ body of armed men ” for protection against disorganisedviolence will become alarmed .\\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state for their own purposes will become emboldened .\\nThat is why , like it or not , the state has no option but to defend itself vigorously whenever it is challenged .\\nParadoxically , the vigour with which challenges to state authority are addressed in their earliest manifestations , the less chance there is that serious , perhaps deadly , force will be required to resolve them .\\nThe Canadian model for the “ Freedom Convoy ” currently defying the New Zealand state is a case in point .\\nBy refusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately , using overwhelming police force , Justin Trudeau ’ s government only emboldened the protest organisers to escalate both their disruption and their demands – to the point where the entire economy of Canada is being constricted at its border-crossing choke-points , and the protest organisers are demanding the resignation of Trudeau and his government .\\nIt is difficult , now , to see Canada ’ s rapidly escalating crisis being resolved without the intervention of the Canadian armed forces .\\nTragically , Canadians are going to end up killing Canadians .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ that its political leaders are forbidden from interfering directly in matters of operational policing .\\nAll well and good , we do not want politicians issuing orders to the Police .\\nBut , this does not mean that a government is required to remain indifferent to what most of the public would regard as a serious dereliction of duty on the part of senior Police commanders .\\nThat the grounds of Parliament have been occupied by

       "  'content': 'Minister of Agriculture Damien O ’ Connor is scheduled to speak at an online summit this week helping to develop “ strategic partnerships with Israel in Agriculture .\\nHere is the Open letter to Damien O ’ Connor from the Palestine Solidarity Network Aotearoa in response .\\nWriting this letter to you reminds me of the letters the anti-apartheid movement wrote to the New Zealand Rugby Union and governments in the 1970s and 1980s in the campaign against apartheid in South Africa .\\nBack then the rugby union and most politicians refused to recognise the appeals from South Africa ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nThey arrogantly ignored the suffering and human rights abuses which went with apartheid and wanted to “ keep politics out of sport ” .\\nToday another anti-apartheid struggle is being waged against the racist , apartheid policies of Israel and its unbridled brutality against the Palestinian people .\\nYour letter pays lip service to Palestinians but expresses solidarity with Israel and its desire to “ keep politics out of agriculture ” .\\nAnd Israeli apartheid – a Crime against Humanity – is no longer in question .\\nIt is an established fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human rights groups : • 2020 – Yesh Din – The Occupation of the West Bank and the Crime of Apartheid : Legal Opinion • 2021 – B ’ Tselem – A regime of Jewish supremacy from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea : This is apartheid • 2021 – Human Rights Watch – A Threshold Crossed – Israeli Authorities and the Crimes of Apartheid and Persecution • 2022 – Amnesty International – Israel ’ s Apartheid Against Palestinians – Cruel System Of Domination And Crime Against Humanity Just like the rugby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century your response tells us the government has chosen the side of the oppressor rather than standing with the Palestinian people .\\nYour 10 February response to our arguments calling on the government to withdraw from next weeks Agritech summit “ building strategic partnerships in agriculture with Israel ” was obviously written for you by foreign affairs staff who are long practiced at avoiding arguments challenging their views and simply trotting out timeworn space fillers which are all but irrelevant today .\\nOnly Foreign Affairs could say “ the New Zealand Government expects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its obligations under international law ” and keep a straight face .\\nFor over 70 years New Zealand governments have been appeasing Israel with these same shabby comments trotted out in public while this racist state continues its systematic human rights abuses against the indigenous people of Palestine .\\nAppeasement has NEVER worked with Israel – just as it hasn ’ t worked with rogue states anywhere in history .\\nBetween the time we wrote and the time you replied , Amnesty International , the largest and most respected human rights organisation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartheid state ( see the link above ) Were you aware of this ?\\nWe have pointed out to you before that Aotearoa New Zealand should have nothing to do with Israel ’ s agriculture sector which is based on : • War crimes ( eg Illegal settlement building on occupied Palestinian land is a war crime under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court ) • Ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from their land and the blatant refusal to allow refugees to return to their land ( UNGA 194 ) • Frequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Israeli Defence Force , on Palestinian farmers ( eg here , here , here and here • Seizure of water supplies and blatant theft of water from Palestinian farmers .\\n( eg here and here ) • Destruction of Palestinian crops and olive groves ( eg here , here , and here ) • Instances of draining sewage onto Palestinian land and crops ( eg here and here ) • Indiscriminate aerial spraying of Palestinian farmland along the border with Gaza .\\n( eg here , here , here , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Zealand Superfund recently took the principled step of withdrawing investments from Israeli bankswhich are funding illegal settlement building on Palestinian land on “ responsible investment grounds ” .\\nAgritech and the New Zealand government however have decided to do the irresponsible opposite – give active assistance to Israel in its exploitation of stolen Palestinian land .\\nThe Israeli Agriculture Ministry , which will take part in your summit , has the specific goal of supporting and assisting illegal Jewish settlements with water supplies and the establishment of agriculture ventures .\\nYour letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nIt is uninformed and ignorant of what goes on in Palestine but there is still time for you to get up to date – the summit is not on till next week .\\nPlease read the Amnesty International report over the weekend so you are informed and have time to withdraw from this event .\\nWe expect nothing less .\\nBy pulling out you will upset racist Israelis who will use false smears of anti-semitism against you but this is a small price to pay for standing on the right side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartheid South African was wrong just as helping Israel exploit stolen Palestinian land is ethically and morally wrong .\\nPlease respond urgently and in your response please indicate you have read this letter and the Amnesty International report .',\n",

       "  'content': 'Twenty years ago , as Parliament last investigated the legal status of cannabis , I was arrested and put on trial for cannabis possession .\\nAlthough I won the case , the fight was lost .\\nNow as another opportunity for reform – the referendum – slips by , we can ’ t wait another two decades .\\nIt ’ s been twenty years , but I ’ m reminded of it every day .\\nOn the 15th of February , 2002 , I was found “ not guilty ” of cannabis possession by Judge Gittos in the Auckland District @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial for a crumb of cannabis following a police sweep of Karangahape Road , not far from where my shop The Hempstore is now located , where I ’ m writing this .\\nIt was so mundane ; it could have happened to anyone .\\nAfter meeting a friend for coffee at Brazil café , we talked a while on the footpath and , minding our own business , we paid no attention to a group of cops in the vicinity .\\nIt turns out they were moving the length of K Road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also turned out they were on a training exercise , with nearby senior officers coaching them on what to do and assessing their performance .\\nThe three young officers approached us with enthusiasm for the task , and dove right into my pockets .\\nI objected , and was told to “ shut up , c*nt !\\n” .\\nThey made me drop my pants in a nearby alleyway .\\nThey eventually found a tin containing a tiny morsel of cannabis and I was immediately arrested , again with some enthusiasm .\\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ve got you , c*nt , you ’ re fucken arrested !\\n” But they didn ’ t know I would get three wins from that arrest .\\nParliament ’ s health select committee was at the time holding an inquiry into the legal status of cannabis , instigated by former Green MP Nandor Tanczos ( also my friend and business partner in The Hempstore ) .\\nPolice and other apologists for prohibition had been telling the inquiry they did not go around looking for cannabis and certainly didn ’ t breach anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were , caught doing it .\\nOf course , what they did to me was a routine occurrence repeated by police many times every day across Aotearoa .\\nContrary to their narrative of only going after Mr Bigs or coming across it while investigating dodgy people for other crimes , the police were at the time arresting more than 15,000 people every year for cannabis , and the vast majority were for possession or use .\\nFortune smiled and I was able to raise awareness with the very committee deciding the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair and Labour MP Judy Keall would shout down anyone who tried to claim police did not go around looking for cannabis , often pointing to me and exclaiming “ I know someone that ’ s happened to recently – and he ’ s sitting right there !\\n” I took that as a win and resolved to use the experience to help keep the inquiry informed about what happens to people who the police choose to arrest for cannabis .\\nAs my trial approached , there was no way I was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness , a great lawyer in Peter Winter , and so many supporters turned up we had to move to a bigger court room .\\nWhile those three young officers had been coached to breach people ’ s rights while performing sweeps of public spaces , they had not been coached well enough on how to tell the same story in court .\\nThey all told different , conflicting versions .\\nJudge Gittos was not very impressed , I was found not guilty , and his ruling set a new precedent : police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cannabis to get around the Bill of Rights and search people who they had no legal authority to search .\\nThe media helpfully let everyone know .\\nIt was the lead on the news that night , and front page of the Herald the next day ( Random street searches unlawful – Weekend Herald , 16-17 February 2002 ) .\\nIt was discussed in Parliament .\\nPredictably , the Police said the ruling would change nothing .\\nPolice Ass spokesperson Greg O ’ Connor said they would continue , business as usual , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took no action against a fellow officer when a larger amount of cannabis was found in her crashed car .\\nBut the precedent from my case can be cited by anyone who police search in public , if they claim they can smell cannabis .\\nEven if they could , that smell could be coming from anywhere , like a car driving past or a person who is no longer there .\\nI ’ ve personally met dozens of people who have been helped by this .\\nThen the third win .\\nFor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had been remanded in custody on cannabis charges .\\nI thought that implied to anyone reading that I was facing serious charges such as large-scale manufacture , or that I had a history of convictions , none of which is true , and that this would seriously impact my reputation .\\nThey refused to retract or apologise , so under Peter Winter ’ s guidance I whipped up a letter which prompted their lawyer to offer $ 5000 to go away .\\nNever take the first offer , Peter advised .\\nWe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10,000 settlement let me embark on an epic cannabis-themed ( and fuelled ) OE .\\nI started at the NORML Conference in San Francisco , then headed to Vancouver and over to London for J Day then the pioneering British coffeeshops in Lambeth , Bournemouth and Stockport .\\nNandor had given me a letter stating I was collecting information on his behalf for the ongoing cannabis inquiry .\\nI met officials in the Netherlands and the UK .\\nI took the Coffeeshop College course which had a practical component of dealing hash in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christiania freezone I bought hash for research purposes .\\nI joined the Cannabis Social Clubs in Barcelona and helped out on cannabis “ tea ” farms in Switzerland .\\nLike much of the world at the time , Europe was experiencing a joyous wave of renewed cannabis freedoms .\\nThis was all reported back to the inquiry , on The DominionPost ’ s dime .\\nBut I got back to what appeared a different country .\\nI had left on a surge of reformist euphoria , with Nandor ’ s inquiry in full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dunne , the televised worm , and his dirty deal to derail cannabis reform .\\nThe worst thing about it was the change had nothing to do with cannabis .\\nThe corngate scandal resulted in Helen Clark going with Peter Dunne ’ s United Future party and casting the Greens into opposition .\\nThe cannabis inquiry was over .\\nIt crawled along for a few months with new members and delivered a watered-down report that made few recommendations of any substance .\\nBear with me because this reminiscing does have a point !\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time “ You ’ re fucked now !\\nIt will be twenty years before this is on the agenda again.\\n” How so ?\\nThey explained the best chance we had before that had been the mid-80 ’ s under Lange ’ s Labour .\\nNow we would have to wait for Clark ’ s government to see out their term , then suffer a period under National , then go for the next Labour-led government .\\nIt won ’ t be in the first term , they predicted , but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservative again as they lose popularity .\\nThis is the cycle , told to me in 2002 .\\nIt came to pass , and it looks like it will happen again .\\nInterestingly , the people at the centre of blocking reform twenty years ago – Peter Dunne , Greg O ’ Connor , and Helen Clark – now all support making cannabis legal .\\nSo here we are , twenty years and thousands of arrests later , in the second term of a Labour-led government .\\nA government which decided to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and then decided to bind itself to the result of a question that had only 30 % support when they decided it .\\nThis was our time , our chance , to finally put an end to the shameful , oppressive , counterproductive Misuse of Drugs Act .\\nThey blew it .\\nThey had better fix it .\\nWe can ’ t wait another twenty years .\\nChris Fowlie is the president of the National Organisation for the Reform of Marijuana Laws NZ Inc ; developer of the CHOISE model for cannabis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a cannabis science company ; co-founder of the New Zealand Medical Cannabis Council ; co-founder of The Hempstore Aotearoa ; resident expert for Marijuana Media on

       "  'content': 'The excerpt in the image below comes from part of the lead story in the weekend ’ s Sunday Star Times .\\nIt paints a picture of the protesters currently occupying Parliament ’ s lawn in decidedly more nuanced terms than the protestors often seem to believe the media interested in doing .\\nNow , the reason that I find this interesting is because of the context of this presentation .\\nBoth in terms of where it was in that day ’ s newspaper , but also how it represents a bit of a ‘ crystalization ’ of a trend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do I mean by this ?\\nWell , we ’ ll start with the second point first .\\nOver the past few days there ’ s been a definite emphasis on the part of some commentators to push the line that the protesters , while they might appear to be a rambunctious rabble of general conspiracy-theory toting ne ’ er-do-wells … “ actually have a point ” .\\nJust what that “ point ” is may vary somewhat from mouthpiece to mouthpiece , but effectively seems to boil down to “ the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” , with a specific flavouring of “ vaccine mandates , Traffic Light Settings , and other Omicron-era control measures are too restrictive / actively harmful ” , and a side-order of “ time to start Learning To Live With The Virus ” .\\nExcept , of course , not ‘ learning to live with the virus ’ in the way that we ’ d been intending to , nor in the way that Singapore et co are attempting to manage it .\\nYou get the idea .\\nNow how much of said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the individual columnist or commentator .\\nSome basically just want to go for the ‘ lightly seasoned ’ option of presenting it as being a Government comms issue that ’ s ‘ legitimate ’ to voice opposition to – others want to go rather further .\\nThis brings us to my second point – the first one I ’ d mentioned , around where this charming excerpt was to be found within the context of Sunday ’ s Star Times .\\nElsewhere on the page was a story about how , surprise surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had allegedly ‘ gone too far ’ and were now actively ‘ counterproductive ’ .\\nThe ‘ meat ’ of this piece was provided via perspectives from two people representing rather different groups : somebody from the hospitality sector , lamenting the manner in which ‘ fear ’ was contributing to people not patronizing restaurants and the like ; and a doctor , talking about how understandable caution from people about going out into the community with Omicron circulating had lead to a rather significant reduction in the number of people making appointments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front page highlight talking about the article lead with the picture and soundbite from the doctor – a public health perspective , and a not unwarranted one .\\nAnd then spent only a smaller portion toward the end of the actual article itself on what he had to say – instead giving over its mainstay to the unrelated commentary around the retail sector suffering due to people not wanting to go out and socialize in the midst of a pandemic .\\nA classic bait-and-switch – and attempt to conflate a commercial issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , people not engaging with primary healthcare providers can contribute to rather more important problems than a bar being underpatronized ) .\\nNow , we ’ ve been down these styles of cycleway many , many times before over the course of the pandemic .\\nThis is partially why we so frequently find heads of business associations , and prominent figures of the hospitality industry given such prominence in media pieces talking about the pandemic response .\\nBecause it ’ s one of the areas where you can actually point to and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\\nIt ’ s got a Cost Attached.\\n” Various media have also been very keen to try and present the situation in more ‘ popular ’ terms – not as something between small and sectorally interested groups against the dominant public will , but rather as the general public being divided in amidst itself .\\nYou can see this in the reporting in the Herald from 2020 , for example , discussing our then second lockdown .\\nThey ’ d declared Auckland to be seriously “ divided ” over the decision to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you looked closer at it … , and as I said about the time – “ You might be forgiven for thinking that this meant somewhere around a fifty fifty split of opinion on the matter .\\n75 % of Aucklanders thought that the extension of lockdown was “ appropriate ” .\\nThis was made up of 56 % who were simply fine with the extension – and a further 19 % who wanted the lockdown to go longer .\\nMeanwhile , that 25 % of opponents was made up of 14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9 % for the lockdown shouldn ’ t have been initiated at all .\\nThat ’ s three-to-one support for the lockdown .\\nAnd yet somehow this is a serious degree of “ division ” .\\nMeanwhile , New Zealanders overall supported the most recent Lockdown by a ratio of more than four to one – 62 % in favour of the lockdown we had , 19 % in favour of an even further extended lockdown , 10 % for a shorter lockdown , and only 6 % for no lockdown at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means “ divided ” , sure – as does a 4-1 majority .\\nBut it sure does sound rather different when you phrase it like that , frame it like that , rather than OVERWHELMING MAJORITY SUPPORTS THE GOVERNMENT ’ S COVID-19 MANAGEMENT ” .\\nSo how does all of that pertain to this description of the protestors on Parliament ’ s front lawn ?\\nAt the moment , the protestors are a very vocal ‘ battering ram ’ .\\nThey won ’ t , by themselves , force the Government to abandon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be ‘ weaponized ’ to do is exactly the same thing that the Brian Tamaki MC ’ d ‘ freedom rally ’ shenanigans of a few months ago can be co-opted for – attempting to make very strident opposition to said “ let ’ s actually live like we ’ re in a pandemic ” measures seem like something that ’ s an ordinary person perspective .\\nNot one that ’ s effectively relegated to a few hundred people on a patch of grass who are outnumbered by an order of magnitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choosing to get a Booster .\\nBecause , as the Sunday Star itself told you on the very same page – New Zealanders continuing to take the virus seriously is imposing an economic cost on some business owners .\\nIt ’ s also continuing to considerably buoy the Labour party ’ s popularity – and keep National down in the low 30 % range .\\nPeople remember .\\nSo , if you want to ‘ circuit-break ’ Labour seeming a champion of ordinary New Zealanders , our health and welfare … presenting some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very-hard-to-ignore decidedly abnormal ones at the Parliament protest is an ideal way to do this .\\nThe mind extrapolates on its own , and places things in their own kind of order – conveying a sense that there ’ s some broad ‘ consensus ’ of both ordinary people and ordinary business-owners gradually coalescing in unity against the Ardern-led Government , mask requirements and vaccination mandates and a ‘ climate of fear ’ about going out for dinner etc .\\nIt doesn ’ t have to be true .\\nIt just has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then the hope is that events start taking on the characteristics plotted out for them all of their own accord .\\nBecause the previous approach , of media and media-platformed talking heads , basically shrilly scolding the general public for taking the pandemic too seriously and being too keen on Labour in significant consequence of that , has not worked .\\nAnd in the absence of a genuine mass movement to overturn the Government or its Covid-control measures … you make do with what you ’ ve got instead .\\nA few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ‘ Annoy Wellington ’ , most definitely … and suitably ‘ airbrushed ’ to highlight the less odious elements within the general protestor milieu .\\nThat remains to be seen .\\nHowever , even though it is situated in amidst nearly half a dozen more ‘ actively empathizable ’ vox-pops , the guy claiming that Covid-19 was some sort of “ worldwide scam directed by the United Nations ” does somewhat undercut the notion that “ we ’ re not crazies ” , as another protestor tearfully sought to emphasize .\\nBut I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few weeks , and one hopes that won ’ t be how long the occupation of Parliament ’ s lawn drags on for , we ’ ll see an escalating tide of media and commentariat ‘ contributions ’ which seek to equivocate the other side of the protest ( you know , the ones intimidating and even egging schoolgirls in masks and spitting at bus-drivers ) in favour of claiming it ’ s ‘ ordinary New Zealanders ’ just seeking to do entirely ordinary things .\\nAnd who have a ‘ right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat out at hospitality venues , too , one presumes .\\nOr maybe that ’ s going to become presented as more of a ‘ duty ’ – something mandatory for the rest of us , whether we feel particularly comfortable going out at this time or not .',\n",

       "  'content': 'Sometimes a politician does something venal and stupid which has the opposite effect they intend .\\nParliament ’ s speaker Trevor Mallard ’ s childish abuse of power in turning on the sprinklers at parliament and playing annoying music to the protest is such an instance .\\nThe police are faced with a difficult situation in Wellington but they are trying to resolve it with engagement and respect rather than tear gas , pepper spray and water cannon .\\nIt ’ s quite alarming that some who have marched on other issues have been calling for a “ strong arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack on the protest would set a low benchmark of tolerance for future civil disobedience protests and our civil rights would be the biggest casualty into the future .\\nThe big majority of people at the protest are decent working-class New Zealanders despite a minority shouting all sorts of deranged things .\\nYes , the protest as a whole is incoherent , contradictory , leaderless and rudderless .\\nBut to stop there is to miss the bigger point .\\nOverwhelmingly it is an expression of frustration and anger at decades of workers struggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is something that happens to you rather than something you shape for yourself .\\nThese people have experienced going backwards economically and socially for 40 years under successive Labour and National governments while the country has been run for the wealthy .\\nThe protestors lack the traditional working-class leadership provided in the past by a strong union movement .\\nThey have developed , quite rightly , a deep distrust of politicians and are therefore susceptible to the masses of misinformation in what one commentator calls the “ rivers of hate ” on social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance , the group has come up with of list of nine issues they want the government to address ( I would agree in all or part with six of them ) It ’ s a reasonable approach in a democracy and the government must engage – not just because a few hundred people in a parliamentary protest are asking for it , but because some of the issues they raise are of widespread concern .\\nI have previously spoken out against government policy on vaccine mandates and their use should be urgently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states have begun to withdraw their use and we should follow ) For example there are enough rapid antigen tests available now to allow unvaccinated teachers and health professionals to turn up to work able to prove they are not infected and therefore safe to do their job alongside their vaccinated workmates .\\nThere is a widespread feeling the government is not listening on issues such as this and the media has inadvertently added to that perception .\\nI can understand and support the media collectively advocating the government ’ s nationwide strategies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a public health emergency and needs a collective nationwide approach for the common good .\\nBut on the other hand the media has suppressed discussion of other options or approaches in the desire not to spread misinformation but this in turn has fuelled conspiracy theories and driven some people further down rabbit holes .\\nThere has been no serious discussion of the need for vaccine mandates for example and the so-called “ team of five million ” has splintered .\\nMeanwhile the wider issue of social media is a much more important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more attention .\\nI have come across two proposals recently from others which I think have real merit and would start to get at the heart of the spread of malicious misinformation online .\\nFirstly , we must use “ whatever means necessary ” to require Facebook to shift to a subscriber model rather than the advertiser-driven model they use at the moment .\\nThere is

       "  'content': 'WHERE IS REALITY HIDING amidst all these claims and counter-claims concerning the protest encampment in Parliament Grounds ?\\nIn an excruciatingly post-modern political moment , reality seems to have gone AWOL , leaving behind only a noisy collection of competing narratives .\\nTo make matters worse , the state itself , supposedly the supreme arbiter of what is and is not politically real , is refusing to do its job .\\nEven though it is his sworn duty , the Commissioner of Police , Andrew Coster , has made it frighteningly clear to the public that he lacks both the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state ’ s authority .\\nThe New Zealand Defence Force , meanwhile , holds itself aloof from the fray .\\nJacinda Ardern and Christopher Luxon , powerless to intervene , look on ineffectually .\\nThe crisis deepens .\\nAsk yourself : what does it mean when tow-truck drivers , asked to assist the Commissioner of Police , refuse ?\\nAt what point during the last decade did citizens begin to tell themselves that they had no obligations to the society in which they live ?\\nThat nobody had the right to tell them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Police ?\\nWhat business is it of theirs if the people of Wellington , their neighbours , need their help ?\\nIt has been reported that at least one towie openly declared his support for the protesters encamped on Parliament Grounds .\\nEntirely understandable .\\nThe occupiers don ’ t accept that their government has the right to require their vaccination against Covid-19 .\\nNor do they believe that they owe their fellow citizens even the slightest co-operation in the fight to limit the harm of the virus .\\nThat tow-truck driver recognised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andrew Coster and Wellingtonians could go fuck themselves .\\nNot all the towies were so bloody minded .\\nAccording to media reports , some of them were just plain scared .\\nThey claimed to have been threatened with dire retribution if they allowed their trucks to be used by the Police .\\nConsidering those trucks carried the names and phone numbers of their owners , it ’ s not difficult to understand the impact of such threats .\\nWere someone to burn down a towing company ’ s premises , torch its trucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a business ruined .\\nWho wouldn ’ t think twice ?\\nSuch tactics are , however , remarkably effective .\\nI remember reading about Jimmy Hoffa and the Teamsters ’ bitter battles with the trucking companies .\\nThe bosses could rely on local politicians , local judges , local editors and local cops to defend them against Hoffa ’ s strikers .\\nThe union was on a hiding-to-nothing , until Hoffa reached out to the Mafia .\\nIt only took a few dozen torched trucks for the bosses to get the message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nBut the spoon Hoffa took to his dinner with the Devil wasn ’ t quite long enough .\\nHis beloved Teamsters ’ Union now belonged to the Mob .\\nNow you might think that people on the left of New Zealand politics would recognise the danger of holding up the occupation of Parliament Grounds as a praiseworthy assertion of working-class power .\\nAs if poverty and marginalisation , frustration and anger , ignorance and credulity are always and everywhere evidence of moral force and progressive intent .\\nKarl Marx himself recognised the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the Lumpenproletariat .\\nAccording to the Encyclopedia of Marxism , this social formation is composed of the “ outcast , degenerated and submerged elements ” of industrial society : “ It includes beggars , prostitutes , gangsters , racketeers , swindlers , petty criminals , tramps , chronic unemployed or unemployables , persons who have been cast out by industry , and all sorts of declassed , degraded or degenerated elements .\\nIn times of prolonged crisis ( depression ) , innumerable young people also , who can not find an opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producers , are pushed into this limbo of the outcast .\\nHere demagogues and fascists of various stripes find some area of their mass base in time of struggle and social breakdown , when the ranks of the Lumpenproletariat are enormously swelled by ruined and declassed elements from all layers of a society in decay.\\n” That our society is in decay can hardly be doubted .\\nThe events of the past ten days offer ample evidence of just how seriously that decay has weakened New Zealand society .\\nA viable Left , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its acute vulnerability to those who would enlist the aid of “ gangsters , racketeers , swindlers , petty criminals ” would have no hesitation in identifying the so-called “ Freedom Convoy ” as the reactionary , quasi-fascist , enterprise it has always been .\\nAlas , New Zealand no longer possesses a viable Left .\\nIdentity politics has schooled a whole generation to accept the self-definitions of “ oppressed groups ” at their face value .\\nDrilling down into the actual character of such groups , and scrutinising their relationship to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nEven among those leftists who still acknowledge the primacy of class politics there is a pronounced unwillingness to subject movements like the Freedom Convoy to any kind of rigorous class analysis .\\nFor these leftists , it is enough that the occupiers of Parliament Grounds are , or were , members of the working-class .\\nSo desperate are these “ revolutionaries ” for the slightest hint of revolutionary consciousness that they are willing to overlook the absence of anything remotely resembling a concrete programme for the social and economic emancipation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence among the occupiers is the one demanding the instant cessation of all measures aimed at minimising the hurt and suffering of Covid-19 .\\nHow self-proclaimed “ socialists ” could possibly mistake such a noxious potpourri of anti-social attitudes for anything remotely progressive is a mystery .\\nPerhaps it is no more than the curious allure of the demi-monde , coupled with the magnetic eccentricities of the Bohemian temperament , that has led these desperate socialists to mistake reactionaries for revolutionaries .\\nClearly they have forgotten that Adolf Hitler himself was a Lumpenproletarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and degenerated ” specimen History has yet to supply !\\nIt was the Italian socialist , Antonio Gramsci ( 1891-1937 ) who grasped the extraordinary fluidity of reality in periods of acute social stress and political disintegration .\\nMoments in history when the hegemonic explanations of the ruling-class have lost , or are beginning to lose , their power to allay the fears and misgivings of subordinate classes .\\nIn such times – and we are living through them now – people are desperate for new and more persuasive narratives about the nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narratives are addressed to the best that is in human nature .\\nSorting out the lies of charlatans and demagogues from genuine revolutionary truths isn ’ t always easy – especially in this age of social-media algorithms .\\nLeftists are often surprised to learn that Mussolini was a socialist before he became a fascist .\\nGramsci put it best when he wrote : “ The crisis consists precisely in the fact that the old is dying and the new can not be born ; in this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ Now is the time of monsters .\\n”',\n",

Jones deserves a lot of credit .\\nHad I been on the receiving end of Kathryn Ryan ’ s and Bridgette Morten ’ s right-wing tag team , as Jones was on RNZ ’ s Monday-morning Political Panel , I ’ m damn sure I wouldn ’ t have kept my cool as impressively as he did .\\nRyan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealing her personal opinions than she was on Monday ( 14/2/22 ) .\\nThat ’ s as it should be .\\nHer role on the Panel is that of moderator – at least , one hopes that ’ s still her role !\\nShe is there to put the questions to the panellists and prevent them from interrupting , talking over one another , and generally attempting to dominate the discussion .\\nThat is not what happened on Monday .\\nRyan threw herself , boots and all , into the debate over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , talked over , and – not to put too fine a point upon it – hectored Jones , to a degree that bordered on the unprofessional .\\nUnsurprisingly , Morten was quick to follow Ryan ’ s lead .\\nShe , too , interrupted and talked over Jones – seemingly with Ryan ’ s blessing .\\nJones , however , remained unfazed by this blatant breach of the Political Panel ’ s rules of engagement .\\nHe stayed resolutely on-message , stoically refusing to let Ryan and Morten rattle him .\\nHe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ didn ’ t lose his temper .\\nHe just kept on talking sense .\\nIt would have helped the listeners immensely if his levels had been set to match those of the two women – then we wouldn ’ t have had to strain our ears to hear him .\\nBut on Monday morning everything seemed to be set against him .\\nThe most intriguing aspect of the whole encounter was the political line taken by Ryan and Morten .\\nBoth women consistently refused to accept Jones ’ s argument that the protest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grip of outlandish conspiracy theories imported from the United States .\\nNor were they willing to accept the well-established Far Right provenance of these conspiracy theories .\\nThroughout the half-hour , Ryan and Morten attempted to paint the protest as the anguished cry of stressed-out Kiwi battlers determined to resist Government over-reach .\\nThe fact that the so-called “ Freedom Convoy ” was always intended to establish a laager of motor vehicles within which a protest encampment in Parliament Grounds could be established and , more importantly , protected , in no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They simply didn ’ t appear to be interested in exploring the strategic purpose of the Convoy ’ s organisers , or what lay behind their radical departure from the norms of New Zealand political protest .\\nEven more disturbing was the way they seemed to brush aside the unprecedented displays of aggression directed at New Zealand ’ s Members of Parliament and the Press Gallery .\\nWellington has witnessed many angry demonstrations in its history , but very few in which the rhetoric of at least some of the participants was explicitly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ryan and Morten so determined to re-focus the debate away from this deeply disturbing reality ?\\nI couldn ’ t help being reminded of the Peter Ellis Case , where the most bizarre , outlandish , and obviously impossible accusations of the children interviewed were simply set to one side so as not to “ prejudice ” the jury .\\nIt simply didn ’ t suit whatever it was that Ryan and Morten were trying to do to have listeners reminded of the murderous fury directed by the protesters against politicians and journalists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ s behaviour is that she was overcompensating for what critics from the Far Right and the Far Left described as the Fourth Estate ’ s sneering , middle-class dismissal of the smelly protesters cluttering up its stately work environment .\\nOn-the-spot reports from intrepid Far Right and Far Left observers , reassuring New Zealanders that the overwhelming majority of the protesters were just ordinary Kiwis exercising their right to protest , have , as intended , shamed a number of mainstream journalists into revising their original stance .\\nIt ’ s possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , is more than savvy enough to realise the damaging impact which the bad behaviour of the protesters , and the baffling failure of the Police to move them on , is having on the Government ’ s reputation .\\nThe longer the protest continues , and the longer the Government and the Police are seen to be standing by ineffectually , the better it is for the Opposition parties .\\nJust because it would not be wise for Christopher Luxon to be seen taking the side of the occupiers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwise for Morten to do everything she can to make it more difficult – from a PR perspective – for Labour and the Police to resolve the crisis .\\nThe Jones boy , every bit as savvy as the Morten gal , knows this .\\nHence his dogged determination to keep his listeners ’ minds focused on the true character of these latter-day “ Freedom Riders ” .\\nThey are not honest toilers , they are people hell-bent on getting rid of the protections Labour has mandated to keep the real honest toilers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grievances – unless you reckon thwarting the sociopathic impulses of unvaccinated extremists constitutes a legitimate grievance .\\nThey are , however , people acting under the influence of individuals and groups with Far Right affiliations and aims .\\nScratch them , and you ’ ll bleed .\\nIn summary , Neale Jones was not “ smacked down ” by Kathryn Ryan and Bridgette Morten .\\nHe was , however , interrupted , talked over , and made extremely difficult to hear .\\nIn spite of all these hindrances , he kept on fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with admirable clarity and forbearance .\\nUnlike the other two participants in Monday ’ s Political Panel , Jones kept his focus on the dangerous realities of the protest taking place in and around Parliament Grounds .\\nFor that he deserves our cheers – not our jeers .',\n",

       "  'content': 'THE PLATFORM has made an invaluable contribution to the increasingly fraught “ debate ” about the Anti-Vaccination Mandate protest in Parliament Grounds .\\nBy commissioning Curia Research to create a rough profile of the protesters , the new website has facilitated the substitution of reliable poll-data for journalistic reckons .\\nNow , at last , the public has at least some of the information needed to render an informed judgement .\\nThat the mainstream news media saw no merit in commissioning such an exercise testifies to its steady retreat from the principles of independent journalism .\\nThe picture painted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn overwhelmingly from rural and provincial New Zealand : Fully 67.6 percent of the persons questioned came from somewhere other than Auckland , Wellington and Christchurch .\\nRural dwellers made up 7.7 percent of the crowd ; those living in provincial towns 18.9 percent ; and provincial city-dwellers the remaining 41 percent .\\nThis latter figure is almost double the actual number of New Zealanders living in provincial cities .\\nThis skewed provincial representation is significant .\\nWhat it tells us is that the people participating in this protest have a great deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donald Trump .\\nThey , too , hailed from places seldom visited by the metropolitan elites .\\nCities and towns that once boasted thriving industries and buoyant economies , but which , over the past 35 years , have seen far too many factories – along with the small businesses that serviced them – shut down and fail .\\nCommunities that once boasted public hospitals , polytechnics , post-offices and banks – not to mention their own proudly independent newspapers – have been stripped of key infrastructure and left to rot .\\nFor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victims of this neglect continued to vote for the parties of change : Labour , the Alliance , the Greens and NZ First ; in hopes that their lives would be made better .\\nCuria Research reveals that very close to 50 percent of the protesters occupying Parliament Grounds voted for one of Labour , the Greens and NZ First in 2020 .\\nThis finding is powerfully reminiscent of the significant number of 2016 Trump voters who had backed Barack Obama in both the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections .\\nHell hath no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a voter scorned , disappointed and betrayed .\\nThat nearly 30 percent of the protesters voted for Jacinda Ardern ’ s Labour Party in 2020 also suggests that at some point the Prime Minister said or did something that shattered their allegiance to her and the Team of Five Million she purported to lead .\\nGiven that the dominant reason/s for their presence outside Parliament was their strong opposition to Vaccine Mandates , one might reasonably speculate that it was Ardern ’ s reneging on her promise not to introduce vaccination mandates and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Labour Party .\\nThat the consequences of refusing to be vaccinated appear to have fallen most heavily on occupations dominated by women : retail , hospitality , teaching , nursing , aged-care , midwifery ; would also explain why Curia Research reports women making up 55 percent of the protest crowd .\\nAnother factor relevant to the number of women participating in the protest could well be that in the rural and provincial communities ravaged by the economic impacts of neoliberalism it has , overwhelmingly , been women who have held together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mothers , daughters and wives who had once been encouraged to look upon the State as their friend , have – decade after decade – been given every cause to see “ the government ” as their enemy .\\nThe explanation for 27.2 percent of the protest crowd identifying as Māori is , almost certainly , much the same .\\nThroughout the 1980s and 90s , in Māori communities scattered across the provincial landscapes of the North Island , jobs , and the social cohesion that came with them , were laid waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industries that paid for them , key infrastructure similarly decayed and disappeared .\\nMāori families left behind had two choices : depart for the big cities ; or , stay put and work out another way to survive .\\nThe same Pakeha state that had stripped their iwi and hapu of their land , was now guilty of stripping them of their jobs , their incomes , and their dignity .\\nWhat loyalty could they possibly owe to such a state ?\\nWhat reason could they possibly have to trust it – or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the other dominant theme recorded by Curia Research ’ s pollsters – Freedom – weighs-in so heavily .\\nAbandoned , overlooked , ignored and despised , the people on the receiving-end of neoliberalism ’ s cold indifference had tragically – but unsurprisingly – internalised its ruthless individualistic ethic .\\nDevalued and declassed , driven to the margins , they had nevertheless contrived to survive on their own terms and according to their own lights .\\nIf the state had no need for them , then they were happy to return the compliment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom – but it was hard-won , and would not be surrendered without a fight .\\nAnd then came Covid , and in its wake a state that would no longer leave them to their own devices .\\nSuddenly , they were included in the “ Team Of Five Million ” .\\nSuddenly , the state which had turned its back on its obligations to look after the people ’ s welfare was demanding that the people honour their obligation to keep it safe .\\nSuspicious , but also secretly thrilled to once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outsiders and outcasts of the provincial lumpenproletariat did as Jacinda asked .\\nBut the requirement to vaccinate – or be turned into a second-class citizen – turned out to be a bridge too far .\\nThe state which , just months before , had pronounced itself their friend was reverting to type .\\nNow it was “ No Jab , No Job ” .\\nNow they were being turned away from the pub .\\nNow the state was coming for their hard-won , hard-scrabble freedom .\\nThe only thing of real value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at imminent risk of being ripped from their hands .\\nThe people in the big cities didn ’ t get it .\\nWhy were “ these people ” so anti-social ?\\nWhy had they so little inclination to serve the “ collective good ” ?\\nIt never occurred to the well-heeled , well-housed and well-educated beneficiaries of neoliberal capitalism that while it was giving them everything , it seldom showed “ these people ” anything other than its anti-social face .\\nAs for the collective good , well , what was that ?\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ big city-dwellers struggle so hard to understand , are the people they have made .\\nIf they don ’ t care about their fellow citizens ’ rights and freedoms , it ’ s because their “ fellow citizens ” never taught them how .\\nDid the algorithms of the social media giants have a role to play in this protest ?\\nYes , of course .\\nAre the dangerous inhabitants of the darkest corners of the Internet feeding the protesters ’ anger ?\\nThey are .\\nBut people are only made ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feed them Big Truths Who is it who gathers at the seat of our democracy ?\\nThey are the feral children of our greed and indifference .\\nWho is it who pounds upon Parliament ’ s doors ?\\nOur own dark shadow that , no matter how hard we try to lose it , refuses to be left behind .',\n",

       "  'title': 'On Coster’s Covid Convoy Strategy',\n",
       "  'content': 'Over the weekend , I tapped out the following : “ In what ’ s going to be my most controversial take this month … I actually think that Police Commissioner Andrew Coster ’ s apparent strategy of “ this ’ ll go down easier if we just let the whole thing implode of its own accord rather than go in swinging ” might be entirely ( if painfully – for Wellington ) correct.\\n” At the time , it seemed a statement against the grain .\\nHashtags demanding Coster ’ s resignation were trending on Twitter .\\nWellingtonians ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed almost as aggrieved at the police for a lack of action against the protest as they were against the protest itself .\\nThe sentiments advanced by some of the commentariat in the Sunday ( and Saturday ) papers seemed to suggest they weren ’ t alone in this – except , of course , for the curious fact that various of those media mouthpieces seemed to be sotto-voce cheering on the protest specifically because it was causing optics difficulty for the Government and our Covid-19 public health response .\\nHowever , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ s behalf .\\nSaturday had seen a rather dramatic occurrence – the revelation that some … unthinking protester had chosen to turn the nation ’ s Cenotaph into an impromptu ablution block for the protest campsite .\\nThis was received in pretty much all quarters about as well as one might expect – as if there is one thing pretty much every New Zealander not of some sort of Anarchist proclivity tends to agree upon , it ’ s the sacrosanct status of the ANZAC legacy .\\nI sensed , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a turning point in terms of the ‘ momentum ’ ( in ) surging into the mainstream of the protest narrative .\\nAnd also noted that it seemed plausible Coster ’ s strategy had been drawn from that of Napoleon – who famously remarked one should “ never interrupt your opponent when he ’ s in the middle of making a mistake.\\n” Subsequent developments seem to have confirmed this – with news stories out about the same time discussing how a citizen-media team who ’ d gone to visit and film the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be non-violent … had been assaulted and “ beaten to a pulp ” ; whilst the next day brought an extended press release from the groups at the center of the Convoy effectively stating that they had little actual control over the protest ( to the point that they couldn ’ t even ensure access for trucks to service the portaloos at the site ) , and that movements toward ‘ negotiation ’ were a “ deflection ” .\\nMonday continued this trend , with the ‘ moral high ground ’ almost certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own excrement about the place .\\nHowever , while it ’ s certainly one thing to observe the ‘ momentum ’ of the movement seemingly fizzle in the harsh glare of public scrutiny of what they ’ re actually about and like ( at least , on the ‘ fringes ’ ) – this isn ’ t quite the same thing as doing something meaningful about the escalating sprawl of tents , cars , and placards which have been steadily encircling further and further around both Parliament and Wellington ’ s key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light of the shuffling around of cars and other potential obstacles which had been taking place toward the end of last week by the protesters in order to entrench themselves further against anticipated towing action .\\nThat , instead , was provided via the rollout of a series of concrete barricades pre-Dawn on Monday Morning .\\nWhich we may surmise to be a rather interesting development for the ‘ Non-Violent Enforcement ’ approach .\\nOne of simply giving the protesters what they want .\\n“ HEY !\\nYOU CAN ’ T JUST BARRICADE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You barricaded yourselves in – we ’ re just agreeing with you.\\n” As it happens , this concords rather well with something I ’ d been thinking about a few days earlier – namely , what one does when one finds one ’ s self having to raise a siege in more conventional conflict terms .\\nI ’ ll spare you the extended military history discursions that conjured in my mind about this point and just skip straight to the answer I ’ d arrived at – you place the siege , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this point , we are going to sidestep for a moment into discussing just how this whole ‘ Protest ’ ethos appears to have come into being .\\nVia a handy metaphor provisioned for us through the realms of physics .\\nWhich , yes , also helps to explain what ’ s going to happen next and why Coster ’ s strategy is likely to work .\\nMy general typology for what ’ s been going on both politically and physically is … a gas .\\nNow , gas differs from liquids and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compressed into a smaller area – which raises pressure as the molecules go pinging bouncing off the walls faster .\\nWhile some have adapted to this by effectively ‘ splitting the difference ’ and attempting to co-occupy ( er..poor choice of words ) space Labour is perceived to hold – others have adapted to a self-perceived shrinking habitat by going gas – and pinging off walls with escalating speed .\\nA good example of this is probably to be found by looking at the National Party from time to time .\\nAfter a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they realized that attempting to carve meaningful votes off Labour by pushing for ‘ business as usual ’ to resume as swiftly as possible , or for that matter , by heading into conspiratorial territory … was not really a good starter .\\nAnd so they instead shifted to a general attack strategy ( as exemplified by Chris Bishop ) of taking something the Government was going to do eventually , and complaining that it hadn ’ t been done faster or better in some fashion .\\nThat ’ s that ‘ splitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ approach .\\nThe other avenue , however , is exemplified by former National MP Matt King , who ’ s effectively become a billboard for ‘ the path not taken ’ by going from overtly opposing in both social media post and deed , the personal distancing rules that were in place in 2020 while he was still a Member of Parliament … through to quitting National in order to return to Parliament in a decidedly other capacity a few days ago as a would-be leader of the Convoy movement , following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herald about some of his more curious beliefs in related areas .\\nSo , to quote me some Sun Tzu – “ Your opponent is Choleric – Irritate Him ” .\\nOr , with these guys “ Your opponent is likely really keen on Conspiracy Theorizing .\\nGive him a reason to distrust the hell out of his neighbour / establishing leadership ” .\\nThe concrete barricades are also good for another purpose .\\nThe protest-groups ’ press-release on Sunday indicated they were already having notable difficulty ensuring that vehicles were able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things like servicing the portaloos .\\nThe rather radical solution of physically disposing of the human waste in question by flinging it at Her Majesty ’ s Constabulary evidently proving inadequate to the task of shoveling sufficient quotients for the hundreds of people on site .\\nVehicles looking to get in to the Convoy ’ s occupation space are now no longer going to be able to come-and-go as convenient .\\nThe police control the access-points in .\\nThose are their barricades .\\nAs an associate observed – that means they now have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weekend , Coster ’ s strategy was what appeared to be a valiant ( if flawed ) effort at what I call the coke-bottle analogy .\\nWhen confronted with a coke bottle that ’ s been shaken up , there are two ways of handling the problem .\\nYou can twist off the lid completely – resulting in a sticky mess everywhere .\\nAll the pressure that ’ s built up explodes outward all at once .\\nOr – you twist off the cap a bit at a time – allowing pressure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the level of force required to twist the cap off all at once , quite understandably , because apart from the possible question as to whether he had sufficient resources in place to actually forcibly evict the occupation once it got past the first day or two … such a spectacle would almost certainly just have lead to a bigger problem elsewhere or elsewhen .\\nThe protesters themselves overtly pointed to the 120+ arrests on the Thursday ( the 10th of February ) as an effective ‘ galvanizer ’ of their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through footage of same going up online .\\nIn other words – their ‘ narrative ’ had found its ogre , its antagonist … and continuing to play that role would be continuing to play into both their hands and that narrative position , strengthening same .\\nHis preference , it would seem , when it became clear how well the previous approach was going ( i.e .\\ninsufficient force being deployed to clear the protest , very sufficient force being deployed to look antagonistic in so doing ) – was to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and delayed release of pressure through smaller cap-twists .\\nExcept it ran into the obvious issue that pressure wasn ’ t actually being decreased .\\nPeople continued to arrive at the protest , and as mentioned above , it would seem that a semi-deliberate strategy of moving to encircle Parliament and various important sites in the area had gotten well underway .\\nTo return to our metaphor – it does little good to gently twist the cap of the coke-bottle part-way around if somebody is still shaking the coke bottle the whole time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mix as well .\\nThe barricades – those of the Police rather than those of the protesters – are , therefore , a welcome ‘ breathing room ’ .\\nThey are not , in and of themselves , a full-scale solution .\\nHowever they do facilitate a gradual de-escalation by hopefully helping to constrain the mean level of ‘ new coke ’ flowing in ; whilst also creating internal conditions that will potentially encourage some people inside to start flowing back out at their own pace .\\nAnd whilst it ’ s very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an ‘ antagonist ’ in one ’ s own preferred flavouring of post-modern morality play … it ’ s a lot harder to vent the same kind of animus toward an inanimate cement block .\\nAt every stage of this pandemic , New Zealand has somehow managed to come out the ‘ least-worst ’ ( indeed , in various cases , actually rather well – our life expectancy going up , for one example ; unemployment hitting an absolute historic low , another ) of much of the world with what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hasn ’ t been through luck ( although yes , most certainly , that ’ s helped in places and in parts ) , but rather through the people making decisions making decent and well-informed ones .\\nEventually , in some cases , but eventually nonetheless .\\nAndrew Coster came to national prominence not for being appointed Police Commissioner – but rather , for being attacked by the Opposition as some sort of ‘ Wokester ’ and adhering to a doctrine ( apparently known in the Anglosphere and practiced in various forms since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d know it ) known as ‘ policing by consent ’ .\\nFor the longest time , it had seemed that he was a man whose prevailing principles had seemed prospectively ill-fitting for the circumstances he had found himself in .\\nOr maybe that ’ s just what the media-political spin sought to suggest .\\nYet Cometh The Hour , Cometh The Man – it may just be that he and his approach might prove the unexpected exact right instrument for handling this current Covid Convoy quagmire .\\nHe would appear to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which some overseas countries have experienced with their own local ‘ Convoy ’ occurrences ( or other anti-Governmental pseudo-uprisings ) – and for that , I think we should be grateful .\\nWill he be the man to preside over what brings about the Convoy ’ s further withering into wittering obscurity and eventual disapparation ?',\n",

stronger than the journalists of the “ evil media ” ; stronger than Andrew Coster and his “ pigs ” ; stronger than anything the corrupt “ system ” could throw at them .\\nEvery attempt by that same system to engage with them and negotiate a peaceful resolution to their occupation was presented by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proof of their enemies ’ diabolical cunning .\\nAll the more reason to “ hold the line ” .\\nThe New Zealand government , and the New Zealand public , were prepared to let Coster give his de-escalation strategy a decent try .\\nBut , their patience was not endless .\\nAs the days turned into weeks , and the occupiers ’ alternative reality kept smashing into the reality of everybody else , even Coster was forced to concede that his policy of reaching out and attempting to establish common ground had failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports began to align more and more alarmingly with the findings of CTAG .\\nThe peace , love and mung-beans crowd was thinning out , replaced by individuals eager to play the roles of “ saviours ” and “ avengers ” – by any means necessary .\\nIt was time to wind it up .\\nAnd wind it up Coster and his highly-disciplined constables did .\\nIn scenes that will long be remembered , the Police in considerable numbers , and properly equipped ( at last ) with the riot gear needed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pepper-spray on the protesters attempting to “ hold the line ” against the Police Commissioner ’ s encroaching army .\\nPeople reeled back in pain and shock .\\nEyes burning , skin burning , stumbling blindly , they were met by “ medics ” carrying 5 litre containers of milk to soothe the fire in the victims ’ eyes .\\nThe skirmishers learned quickly to turn their backs to the Police , but that just offered the men and women with the riot shields increased surface area upon which to apply pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was driven back .\\nAnd on this , the 23rd day , unlike all the other days , the Police did not stop .\\nLike the amplified messages on continuous loop telling the protesters that continued resistance would result in arrest , phalanxes of police officers just kept on coming .\\nSoon , every corner of “ Freedom Village ” was under assault .\\nLike a garotte , the contracting police lines began to slowly but surely throttle the protest .\\nThere was no perimeter to defend now , the blue tide was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the occupiers ’ tents , hurling them aside .\\nThen the fires broke out .\\nTents and belongings burned .\\nThe protesters ’ angry retreat became a rout .\\nThe Götterdämmerung the extremists had willed into existence over the preceding 22 days was finally upon them .\\nBlack smoke billowed-up from beneath the Pohutakawas , swirled around the statue of King Dick Seddon , and scudded over the nation ’ s Parliament on the wings of an early-autumn wind .\\nNew Zealand had never seen anything like it .\\nIn the dying days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British and Americans advanced deeper and deeper into western Germany , and the news of Adolf Hitler ’ s suicide spread , his people began to give up .\\nHis soldiers , too , started to surrender .\\nOne of these was photographed by Allied newsmen .\\nHans-Georg Henke was just sixteen , one of the boy soldiers that had been Nazism ’ s last hope , and he was weeping openly before the cameras .\\nHis child ’ s face a pitiful picture of hurt and confusion .\\nWhat had it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led Germany into this nightmare of death , destruction and defeat .\\nWhy had the German people allowed him to set their whole world on fire ?\\nThe look in the eyes of that young woman , as she clung tearfully to her young man in the middle of Molesworth Street on the 23rd day of the occupation ; and the expression on the face of Hans-Georg Henke ; were strikingly similar .',\n",

its nature , its starting point and whether to prosecute .\\nPenalties were imposed for infringements of the rulebook rule alongside an appeals process stacked in MSD ’ s favour and without oversight by an outside body .\\nAn another unpleasant feature of the 2007 changes exploited by National was to expect that before asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their own resources .\\n“ …that where appropriate they should use the resources available to them before seeking financial support under this Act ” .\\nThe culture took hold that if the beneficiary had borrowed money because they could not survive on a benefit such loans could be treated as income reducing entitlement to the same benefit .\\nCPAG was involved in a case ( Ms F ) in which a family loan resulted in a review of a sole parent ’ s five years ’ expenditure and establishment of a debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A High Court decision was needed to get this over-turned but there was no review of the practice and the implications for others similarly affected but without access to pro bono legal resources to sustain an 8-year fight with MSD .\\nSo it is with some surprise that the latest efforts to rewrite the ‘ Purposes and Principles ’ retains “ where appropriate [ beneficiaries ] should use the resources available to them before seeking financial support under this Act ” .\\nThe primacy of paid work is slightly moderated to “ employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity for people to achieve wellbeing ” .\\nThere is no visionary statement about the purpose of social security being not only to alleviate actual poverty when it occurs but to prevent it and enable participation and belonging in society .\\nRather the best that can be can be mustered in the 2022 report is “ Social security contributes to the wellbeing of the community by providing support to reduce poverty and hardship.\\n” It is shameful that the work of WEAG is invisible , and even more time is expected of past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to engage in so called consultation on what looks like a make-work exercise .',\n",

spectacular migration from the unnoticed ideological fringes to the glare of prime-time politics .\\nIn exactly the same way that a largely unknown provincial agitator was catapulted into the national German spotlight by his failed “ Beer Hall Putsch ” of 1923 , the rioters of 2/3/22 have succeeded in seizing Middle New Zealand by the ear .\\nThe Daily Blog ’ s editor , Martyn Bradbury , estimates that the dramatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Alt-Right string-pullers behind the occupation and its cataclysmic finale .\\nIf he ’ s correct , then that is roughly enough voting power to crest the 5 percent MMP threshold and secure 6 seats in the House of Representatives – assuming , of course , that the Alt-Right can arrive at an ideological consensus strong enough to permit the creation of a coherent political party .\\nThere is , however , no evidence to suggest that such a coming together of the volatile elements on display in Parliament Grounds is imminent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that brought the doings of the “ Freedom Village ” to around 30,000 people per day during the occupation , all-too-easily emboldens those on the losing side of major debates to strike out on their own .\\nNot only that , but it provides a public stage where the personal animosities of the major players can be played out for the edification of friends and foes alike .\\nIn the absence of an Adolf Hitler-type figure with the requisite intellectual , ideological , rhetorical and political skills to transform the brawling and fissiparous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conclusions of the SIS ’ s Combined Threat Assessment Group ( CTAG ) are almost certainly correct .\\nThe locus for effective action on the Alt-Right will shrink down to the level of the “ Lone Wolf ” .\\nThose dangerously alienated individuals who see themselves as either the “ saviours ” of their race , or the “ avengers ” of those whose rights and freedoms have been stripped away by tyrannical blood-drinking paedophiles .\\nUnder discussion here is terrorism – pure and simple .\\nAcross the national security community there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they witnessed the fire and smoke of the twenty-third day , were thinking of what a more organised and tactically aggressive leadership might have achieved on the first or second day of the protest , when the defences and defenders of Parliament were at their weakest .\\nHad 500 or 1,000 brawlers of the sort who hurled paving stones at the Police on 2/3/22 rushed up the steps of Parliament Buildings on 9/2/22 and forced their way through the doors – who could have stopped them ?\\nWould New Zealanders , like Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a crazed anti-vaxxer seated in the Speaker ’ s Chair ?\\nWould a noose-swinging lynch mob have made their way up the Beehive stairwells crying “ Ja-cin-daaa !\\n” And , having seen a dozen of their comrades shot down by the Prime Minister ’ s bodyguards , would they have set fire , not to pup-tents , but the Beehive itself ?\\nThere are senior “ public servants ” across Wellington brooding worriedly today upon what could so easily have happened because , exactly as the Royal Commission of Inquiry into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too little attention has been paid , by those whose duty it is to protect the national security of New Zealand to , the Alt-Right and its kindred subversives and terrorists .\\nNot the least worried of these public servants will be Police Commissioner Andrew Coster .\\nHe will be asking all manner of questions about why his own intelligence division failed to anticipate the scale of the crisis the foreign-inspired Alt-Right promoters of Convoy 2022 were determined to provoke on the grounds of Parliament .\\nOne can only imagine the cold fury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same questions at New Zealand ’ s chief law-enforcement officer .\\nWith the events of 15 March 2019 – and now 2 March 2022 – etched upon her mind , Jacinda Ardern will be more determined than ever to curb the expression of hate speech .\\nOn her side of the House ( and among a fair proportion of those seated on the opposite side ) there will now be even less patience for those who attempt to keep the banner of free speech flying .\\nAmong the public there will likely be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ s stance .\\nIn the minds of more and more New Zealanders it is now the defence of society itself that must take precedence .\\nIncreasingly , the defenders of free speech will come to be seen as the defenders of those who not only use their freedom of expression to cry “ Fire !\\n” in a crowded theatre , but then do all they can to persuade the audience to burn the theatre down .\\nThat so many members of the Free Speech movement genuflect to the Right , rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the resolve of those determined to silence the pedlars of arson and murder who – to borrow the Prime Minister ’ s expression – “ desecrated ” the holy precincts of New Zealand ’ s democracy .\\nComing down hard on hate speech will only be the beginning .\\nIt is highly likely that the Law Commission will be tasked with reviewing the effectiveness of the legal weaponry currently available to a Government under siege .\\nGeoffrey Palmer ’ s giddy bonfire of the repressive instruments of state power has taken on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer in vogue .\\nFinally , there is the formidable apparatus of New Zealand ’ s national security community , most particularly the SIS and the GCSB .\\nIt should be presumed from here on out that those who blithely spout prejudice and hatred online will be simultaneously announcing themselves as “ persons of interest ” to all those who wield the swords of state protection .\\nTo the stone-throwers and tent-burners out there , girding their loins for another crack at the lizard people and their lackeys , the most useful advice @ @ @

persuaded that the occupiers of Parliament Grounds were ordinary , decent New Zealanders engaged in a political protest indistinguishable from a host of similar demonstrations scattered across New Zealand ’ s recent history ?\\nThe most obvious answer is that on both sides of the political spectrum there is a powerful ideological and emotional need to represent the protest as neither threatening nor unusual .\\nBoth conservatives and revolutionaries have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the “ innocence ” of the protesters , and the “ guilt ” of the Government , is indisputable .\\nWhat could that common interest possibly be ?\\nOne possible answer is that the protest offered spectacular proof that “ the people ” still possessed the power of independent action .\\nAs the NZ Herald ’ s John

physical assault ) of innocent citizens going about their lawful business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incidents of Wellingtonians being accosted in the street , by protesters visibly incensed by their attempts to protect themselves from infection , as nothing more than “ scoffing at people in masks ” .\\nSuch minimisation of the actual harm experienced is , sadly , essential if one ’ s purpose is to maintain the fiction that this was a “ peaceful protest ” .\\nIt is instructive to compare the description of these same incidents offered by two Marxist revolutionaries , Daphne Whitmore and Don Franks .\\nIn

description is a definite improvement on Roughan ’ s “ scoffing ” .\\nBut , although the writers concede that for some the experience was “ deeply traumatising ” , they also explain how “ [ m ] any more just wandered on , ignoring the rants as you do with anyone who seems a bit unhinged.\\n” Crucially , they then add : “ Those interactions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then conflated with the occupation as a whole.\\n” Once again , the purpose is to inoculate the occupation from charges that it was anything other than a “ peaceful protest ” .\\nThe inescapable problem for both Roughan and Whitmore/Franks is how to explain the extraordinary violence of the twenty-third day of the occupation .\\nThey manage it , however , by employing the oldest explanation in politics : the minority responsible for the fires and the violence were in no way representative of the overwhelming majority of the protesters .\\nRoughan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Police Commissioner , Andrew Coster , for the way he dealt with this alien violent element – presenting his final decision to clear Parliament Grounds as a “ relief ” for all the peaceful protesters , who dutifully packed-up and went home .\\nWhitmore/Franks are more straightforward .\\n“ After 23 days camped outside parliament the End the Mandates protest was stormed by 500 riot police .\\nA few hundred hardcore protesters fought back all day , and around a hundred were arrested.\\n” It was the Cops wot done it .\\nAt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one senses a deep resentment that the views of persons like himself , powerful White conservative males , did not prove decisive in determining the Labour Government ’ s handling of the Covid-19 Pandemic .\\nSuch men are not used to being ignored .\\nThe inconvenient fact that the young , female Prime Minister who declined to accept their advice went on to be re-elected in a landslide victory only rubbed salt in their wounds .\\nIt isn ’ t the fact that Roughan and his ilk represent a minority that galls them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always be a minority ) it is that they have been required to share the fate of the minorities which , when power was in conservative hands , they were happy to ignore .\\nThe person they blame for this insupportable state of affairs is Jacinda Ardern : “ Once the grounds were cleared , the Prime Minister addressed the nation .\\nShe was not conciliatory .\\nShe said the violence had vindicated her refusal to engage with the protest for three weeks .\\nShe said the occupation would not define us.\\n” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she ultimately decides just about everything we can do .\\nShe can decide to shut shops , close schools , cancel events , keep us confined to home .\\nShe even decides what is best for our health .\\nBut she doesn ’ t get to decide what defines us .\\nNot all of us.\\n” Seldom has a conservative writer provided his readers with such a clear view of his politics – nor one so chilling .\\nThe clue to Whitmore ’ s and Franks ’ uncompromising position on this issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ostensibly pro working class groups painted the occupation as entirely negative and ‘ reactionary ’ , with zero recognition of the social and economic deprivation which had driven many protesters to participate .\\nSignificant sections of End the Mandate protesters included trades people and health professionals who had lost their jobs .\\nThat is what drove them to arrive at parliament with their families , demanding audience with the government.\\n” What neither writer attempts to explain , however , is why so many other working-class New Zealanders – Māori and Pasifika working-class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also the victims of “ social and economic deprivation ” , fought Covid by organising collective action and mutual support .\\nThese were the “ essential workers ” who stayed at their posts throughout the lockdowns because , if they hadn ’ t , thousands of their fellow citizens would have died .\\nThe protesters on Parliament Grounds did not “ lose their jobs ” – they gave them up because they refused to accept the social obligation of vaccination , and then , selfishly , refused to accept the consequences of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” been erected in the name of social justice , by workers determined to build a better world .\\nHad the protesters not blocked city streets , assaulted passers-by , and prevented schools , universities , businesses and courts from functioning .\\nHad they not swung nooses and issued death threats .\\nThen their brutal suppression by 500 police officers would , indeed , have been shameful .\\nBut , the hard , cold truth of the matter is that this protest was a manifestation of narcissistic , sociopathic , passive-aggressive and violent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nIt was a gathering of the deluded and the deranged .\\nThe only freedom sought was the freedom to ignore the obligations attached to being fully human .\\nAnd that is pretty much the definition of “ reactionary ” .\\nNo matter how hard Daphne Whitmore and Don Franks might wish it otherwise , a revolution by proxy just isn ’ t possible .',\n",

       "  'content': 'Like various recent National Party leaders before him , Christopher Luxon appears to have a bit of difficulty Reading The Room .\\nIt ’ s a remark of general application , however in this specific case the room in question is “ a modest Moscow flat ” .\\nConfused ?\\nSo ’ s he .\\nWhy ?\\nBecause The Numbers Don ’ t Add Up .\\nLuxon found himself in that modest Moscow flat at some point after he joined Unilever , and was touring the world meeting “ management ” of that company as he slowly edged his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s possible that I ( and David Cormack , whom I note beat me to the idea for this piece ) am in error about this , but I somehow don ’ t think that Luxon was in Moscow during the era of anything which might feasibly be termed “ Socialism ” .\\nMost likely , considering he joined the company in 1993 and spent the first few years based in Wellington ( where , to be sure , he may have wandered down Cuba Street and felt a bit lost in both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ventured over to Moscow when he was based out of London from 2000-2003 .\\nNow if that ’ s the case , then I can certainly agree that he likely encountered quite the swathe of “ misery ” in that town – however , with somewhere between ten and thirteen years since the fall of the USSR , and up to a decade since the associated dismantling of the Soviet economic system … is it really fair to say that the “ misery ” in question was “ created ” by “ socialism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure .\\nI suppose it comes down to how much you blame the Soviet system for existing – and therefore providing the opportunity for undoing said system in a really , really damaging way .\\nWhich , perhaps not uncoincidentally , also saw a fairly massive-scale transfer of wealth from the state to a very small number of private citizens – whilst for ordinary Russians life got significantly worse .\\nA bit of an interesting thing given Luxon ’ s major theme in yesterday ’ s speech was the apparent ‘ necessity ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which will only benefit the wealthy ( that is – the top 3 % of income earners ) , and which we can fairly assume to be accompanied by constraints in state support and spending .\\nIn the five years from 1989 to 1994 , average Russian life expectancy went backwards by nearly five years – that is to say , Russians died , on average , five years earlier under that phase of the Market ’ s unfurling as compared to under the previous Soviet system .\\nLife expectancy wouldn ’ t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2011 – almost a full generation after the Market began to be rolled out in earnest .\\nThis compares rather unfavourably , it must be said , with the situation of the USSR from , say , 1950 to 1965 – where life expectancy relatively shot up from just over 50 through to just under 68 … and , I suppose , comparing either of those numbers to the average pre Soviet Union , which appears to have never made it past the early 30s .\\nWe often do not quite adequately appreciate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faults , the USSR did manage to take an expanse of what would barely be Third World conditions today , and not only put a man in space less than 40 years later but also manage to make meaningful improvements in quality of life for its citizenry as well .\\nWe often fall into something of a trap of choosing to measure Soviet ( and Russian ) achievements in these spheres relative to a yardstick derived from the ( theoretically ) most materially abundant society on the planet – America ; rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirt floor ’ the USSR built itself up from .\\nIn fact , not just a ‘ dirt floor ’ – but a floor on fire , when the immense devastation of the Second World War is taken into consideration .\\nThe point is , by the late 1990s , it had become abundantly clear that the Market had not brought the fabled prosperity promised by the modern Western economics textbook .\\nFor many it was quite the opposite .\\nShortly before Luxon likely arrived in Moscow , for instance , unemployment was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1999 .\\nGoing back a bit further , we ’ ll just quote this paper from the British Medical Journal verbatim : “ The report Transition 1999 stated that suicide rates have climbed steeply too , by 60 % in Russia , 80 % in Lithuania , and 95 % in Latvia since 1989 .\\nBut behind the self destructive behaviour , the authors say , are economic factors , including rising poverty rates , unemployment , financial insecurity , and corruption .\\nWhereas only 4 % of the population of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( £2.50 ) a day or less in 1988 , that figure had climbed to 32 % by 1994 .\\nIn addition , the transition to a market economy has been accompanied by lower living standards ( including poorer diets ) , a deterioration in social services , and major cutbacks in health spending .\\n“ What we are arguing , ” said Omar Noman , an economist for the development fund and one of the report ’ s contributors , “ is that the transition to market economies [ in the region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen in the 20th century , if you take out famines and wars .\\nThe sudden shock and what it did to the system … has effectively meant that five million [ Russian men ’ s ] lives have been lost in the 1990s.\\n” Using Britain and Japan with their ratio of 96 men to every 100 women as the base population , the report ’ s authors have calculated that there are now some 9.6 million “ missing men ” in the former communist bloc .\\n“ The typical patterns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and develops a drinking problem , ” said Mr Noman .\\n“ The women then leave and the men die , first emotionally and then physically.\\n” So that ’ s what Luxon was in amidst when he “ [ remembers ] sitting in a modest Moscow flat with a couple in their late 40s on a dark and snowy afternoon.\\n” Sure sounds like “ actually created misery ” – although other than the weather ( it ’ s probably a bit hard to be cheery on a “ dark and snowy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious lack of any mention for any then-contemporary causations for the malaise Luxon observed there at the time .\\nProbably because it wouldn ’ t fit his narrative today .\\nWhat ’ s that narrative ?\\nA proverbial red flag .\\nThat Labour , having steered us remarkably well ( if not , it must be said , always perfectly – they are human , as are we ) through a global pandemic ( which we are still traversing ) through the judicious use of the powers of state effectively unprecedented in peace-time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , more than that … Soviet Socialists .\\nVia inferency , aligned to “ Moscow ” – which , given events of this past week and a half , is a toponym which carries quite some additional ‘ dark ’ ( and perhaps ‘ snowy ’ ) connotations to it .\\nPerhaps he wants to pick up from his previous big speech ( curiously enough , also on the ‘ state of the nation ’ ) – the one in which he set out his belief that we ought to “ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised by protesters on Parliament ’ s grounds without being framed as condoning illegal behaviour or siding with anti-science conspiracy theorists.\\n” I ’ m sure he could borrow a “ Cindy Stalin ” hammer-and-sickle adorned placard from some of his friends-of-friends from the fringier bits of Groundswell if he gets sick of trying to do the subtle thing with his rhetoric .\\nIn any case , Luxon ought be careful about basing his ‘ reckons ’ for Middle New Zealand off one conversation in a Moscow flat .\\nPolling has fairly consistently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually think the Soviet system being dismantled was a bad thing .\\nThis isn ’ t some heavily manipulated and unreliable propaganda survey , either – other than the Levada annual polling on the question , you ’ ve also got the well-regarded Pew Research Center findings .\\nIn fact , especially according to the latter , the number of Russians who view the transition to the market system as being a good thing has been steadily declining year upon year – hitting about 38 % in 2019 per Pew .\\nOf additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ – it ’ s the people who actually grew up and lived under the Soviet system that are chiefly driving the numbers there .\\nThe young generation who had no experience of the Soviet system are the ones that are most likely to say they think the new market economy was a good move – as they ’ ve never known anything else .\\nBut we are not here to make the case for ( or , for that matter , against ) the Soviet Union .\\nIt was a faraway country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bore little resemblance to anything we might find here in New Zealand – even the famed ‘ Dancing Cossacks ’ of a previous National election campaign are simply a two dimensional caricature .\\nMuch like Luxon ’ s rhetoric here , and no doubt pertaining to a great many things .\\nThe point is a simple one .\\nIf Luxon wants to audition for the role of Prime Minister of New Zealand , he ’ d do a better job if the concerns he sought to represent were those of regular New Zealanders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago who , as it turns out , may not have been all that representative of ordinary Russians even then .\\nThere is a certain segment of the New Zealand body-politic – the armpit of democracy , we may perhaps call them , after the sounds they seem to make for jocularity-value upon talkback radio for puerile self-amusement purposes – who probably do , either genuinely or reasonably enthusiastically facetiously , believe that New Zealand ‘ runs the risk ’ of becoming some sort of “ Communist ” state .\\nOr that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evinced between Putin rolling armoured vehicles into Ukraine and the NZ Police deploying riot shields and a fire-hose against a protest featuring a literal dumpster fire last week .\\nSome of those were the sort of people so unduly concerned about “ Communism ” here in New Zealand and a creeping surveillance state with Orwellian characteristics , that they immediately chose to go and set themselves up a commune , in public view and with extensive round-the-clock live-streaming of their every move whilst attempting to redefine reality to fit on an hourly if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declaring their vigorous intent to defend our democracy … by ‘ temporarily ’ overthrowing it and potentially holding some very Soviet-Stalinist seeming Show-Trials into the bargain .\\nLuxon was quite rightly pilloried not all that long ago for attempting to wade into that particular ‘ debate ’ and designating ‘ Well Both Sides Have A Point ’ as an attempted ‘ wedge politics ’ against not only our Government , but also the broad majority of the people of New Zealand heartily unimpressed with that sad opposition-for-opposition ’ s- sake spectacle recently occuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , not the National Party for a change ) .\\nHe ’ s probably – or , rather , his focus-groupers – identified a bit of a seam of disgruntlement out there in the electorate , one which is currently extant effectively as a few embers , but which his handlers hope could be blown upon to get it to grow and inflame into a more American-style political combustion with enough effort and spurious soundbitery .\\nSomething somewhat availed , for rhetorical-symbological purposes by the fact that the past week and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have put us squarely back in the 80s in various regards .\\nExpect , over the next year and a half , Luxon to continue to needle along exactly these lines in various subtle ( or not-so-subtle ) hues .\\nHow effective will it be ?\\nWell , that ’ s over to you .',\n",

       "  'content': 'The effects of a new drug-driving law passed by Parliament yesterday , which ignores the science around testing for impairment , will be felt mostly by the poor and already oppressed .\\nThe middle classes will just Uber their way around it .\\nThe Land Transport ( Drugged Driving ) Amendment Act imposes a new testing regime on Kiwi drivers , with fines for lower residues of drugs and criminal charges for higher amounts .\\nWhile no one wants impaired drivers on the road ( NORML has promoted it ’ s Principles of Responsible Cannabis Use , which includes ‘ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this law had gone from ‘ pretty good ‘ to pretty bad .\\nThe way people roll the dice will determine what penalty , if any , they face .\\nMost drivers will first be asked to perform two saliva tests .\\nOr they can ask for a blood test – but that could come back on them , because while failing a saliva test will attract a fine , failing a blood test could result in court proceedings and a criminal conviction .\\nThe saliva testing devices will be set at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 25 drugs – both illicit and prescription medicines – the device will pick up just five others ( meth , MDMA , benzos , cocaine , opiates ) .\\nYou must fail two saliva tests , because the test devices themselves are somewhat unreliable .\\nFailing the saliva test attracts a fine , and a ban on driving for 12 hours .\\nIt ’ s important to note that the device is set at 1ng THC not because any science says that is the level of impairment , but because that ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The expert committee charged with determining what levels equate to impairment gave up – because the science says it ’ s actually very difficult to pick one number for everyone , especially when it comes to cannabis .\\nSo instead , they just went with the device sold in Australia .\\nIt ’ s not based on impairment , but it will pick up what someone consumed yesterday .\\nHowever the new law allows any police officer who is trained to give the test , to require anyone driving to perform a compulsory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Field Sobriety Test – instead of the saliva tests .\\nThis involves tasks like standing on one leg and touching your nose , walking a straight line , correctly estimating 30 seconds elapsed , and so on .\\nThese can be accurate if overseen by a trained officer .\\nBut they can also be quite difficult for many people , take up to 40 minutes to perform , and are mostly subjective to observe and score .\\nA significant number of sober people will fail them , and NZ police don ’ t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to review .\\nFailing the field test means a blood test .\\nAny driver who fails the field sobriety test , or who refuses to perform a saliva test , or who fails two saliva tests and elects to do so , will have a blood sample taken and tested .\\nThe blood test will be evidential and can be used in court against you .\\nIf a driver is found to be above the ‘ tolerance level ‘ ( again , 1ng for THC ) , they will be fined .\\nIf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ criminal level ( 3ng for THC ) they can be charged in court and convicted .\\nThe levels set in the new law do not equate to impairment .\\nA person testing over these levels could be impaired , but maybe they ’ re not .\\nIn particular , residues of cannabis consumption can linger for hours or even days after past use .\\nTo be fair , a blood test is way better than workplace-style urine testing , which detects cannabis use for up to four months after last use .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick up only the active ingredient ( THC ) , whereas urine testing detects the inactive metabolite ( THC-COOH ) remaining after use .\\nBut a regular cannabis user may still find they fail the proposed tests the day after their last use .\\nA heavy user , such as many patients who use medicinal cannabis , may find the test above 1ng or 3ng for much longer .\\nThe levels are not only set too low , but the science says picking any number for cannabis is problematic and does not actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nFor example prior studies have shown that while THC inhalation is associated with changes in driving behaviour , such as an increased likelihood of weaving , but also a decrease in drivers ’ average speed .\\nThese and other changes are typically less pronounced in people who are regular cannabis consumers , but they may be exacerbated when alcohol and cannabis are ingested in combination with one another .\\nAlcohol drinkers , meanwhile , have a testing regime much more closely aligned to actual impairment , and the science to back it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are following their doctor ’ s orders – the same as any other prescription medicine .\\nBut you can expect prescriptions to now have explicit instructions to not drive for X hours ( and ‘ X ’ will vary depending on the doctor ) .\\nCBD is not covered , because it is not psychoactive and not associated with driving performance .\\nLooking to Australia and America , the middle classes who enjoy a toke or some molly at the ol ’ dinner party will just use Uber to get everywhere .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ law .\\nAnyone who can afford it will opt to pay the fine , every time .\\nThere ’ s no criminal record , just loss of driving and another bill they can afford .\\nBut if you can ’ t afford it , or the cops don ’ t like the way you look , those low levels set for tests will mean easy convictions and much larger impacts .\\nThe poor and the brown , yet again , will bear the brunt of this drug law enforcement .',\n",

a lesser degree of enthusiasm for Steps 3 and 4 ; and almost no willingness to proceed to Step 5 .\\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s take another look at Step 1 .\\nIn the past , politicians began the process of social reform already knowing what they wanted to achieve .\\nThis was especially true in the Labour Party , whose entire raison d ’ être was changing society for the better .\\nIf you didn ’ t have strong opinions on what needed to be done , and how to do it , then what was the point of becoming a Labour Member of Parliament ?\\nThis predisposition towards changing the world added an important twist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when assembling your experts you were careful to ensure that a majority of them , and the Chair in particular , shared your own ( and the Party ’ s ) view of what needed to be done .\\nSince Labour politicians spent a lot of time talking with all kinds of experts about social and economic reform , picking the right people wasn ’ t difficult .\\nIt also meant that Steps 2-5 were pretty much a pro-forma exercise .\\nClearly , the present Labour Party is very different from the Labour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\\nThe answer , as always , is : Rogernomics .\\nA crucial aspect of Rogernomics was its ferocious intolerance of the moderate social-democratic thinking that had for decades pervaded not only the Labour Party , but also the union and academic circles which constituted the principal intellectual reservoirs of Labour policy .\\nInspired and advised by the neoliberal ideologues of Treasury , the core leadership of the Fourth Labour Government made it clear to their colleagues that any attachment to the old ideas and the old sources of advice would not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiastic union officials of yesteryear were banished to the outer darkness , and in their place a whole new breed of ideologically kosher policy advisers stepped forward .\\nHenceforth , the overwhelming majority of experts called upon to guide governments would be convinced Neoliberals .\\nThe old ideas and old sources of advice did not go down without a fight .\\nIndeed , the ideological conflict within Labour between 1984 and 1989 was so intense that it split the party .\\nFor those who remained loyal to the Labour Party , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a profound change .\\nThere were now clear perimeters beyond which the guardians of the Rogernomics Revolution did not permit the party to venture .\\nGay Marriage ?\\nWhy not .\\nCompulsory Unionism ?\\nNo way For those who lived through these intense debates and debacles it all seems like yesterday .\\nBut , it isn ’ t .\\nIt is very nearly 40 years since the Rogernomics Revolution and its intensification under Ruth Richardson transformed New Zealand society .\\nA New Zealander born in 1984 , could easily have a 20-year-old son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nThe Prime Minister herself was only four years old when Roger Douglas became Minister of Finance .\\nAnd Jacinda Ardern ’ s own Finance Minister , Grant Robertson , was just thirteen .\\nMost of the members of Labour ’ s caucus have grown up in an intellectual environment completely dominated by Neoliberal ideas .\\nThose who attempt to revive the social-democratic ideals of the pre-1984 Labour Party come before today ’ s Labour MPs with the unwelcome historical taint of the NewLabour splitters and Jim Anderton ’ s doomed Alliance .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Government ’ s Neoliberal advisers as intellectual Neanderthals : people who simply do not know how the world works ; cretins and naïfs who should be kept as far away from real political power as possible .\\nUnfortunately , the bits and bytes of twenty-first century Hyper-Capitalism long ago ceased to respond to the impulses of mere human ideology .\\nThough they dare not admit it , the Neoliberals have lost control of the machine .\\nAll they are capable of now is presenting increasingly implausible explanations for why everything has gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the politicians expected to front for the damage done by the Invisible Hand are in the market for some credible alternatives to more of the same .\\nWhen Jacinda and Grant sign-off on yet another working group it ’ s not because they know already what they want the experts to tell them , it ’ s because the experts they currently rely upon for advice have run out of answers , and they are genuinely interested in what these new experts might say .\\nWhen the reports emerge , however , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been written by Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio Cortez , or Max Rashbrooke and Susan St John .\\nThe lips of their bureaucratic advisers curl contemptuously ; their media advisers ’ eyebrows arch provocatively ; and with a heartfelt sigh the hapless politicians set the offending document on top of the surprisingly high pile of its predecessors .\\nAnother No Go .\\nThe brilliant creators of “ The Simpsons ” television series said it all in the episode satirising the ideas of Ayn Rand .\\nOn the walls of the Randian childcare centre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doesn ’ t Help ” .\\nIt ’ s the story of this government ’ s life .',\n",

       "  'content': 'Earlier today I saw some excitement from people in response to a US DoD assessment that the Russian military in Ukraine was , and I quote , “ 95 % still intact ” as of yesterday .\\nThis was taken by some of those commenting on the article as their having suffered 5 % losses – and seemingly , thousands of Russian KIAs as a result .\\nThe inference people drew from the headline was , perhaps understandably , that the Russians were going very badly .\\nExcept here ’ s the thing .\\nThat ’ s not at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ ll start with the obvious one – the presumption that “ 95 % still intact ” means one man in every twenty that the Russians had sent in is now dead or severely wounded .\\nThat is not the case .\\nMeasuring the combat power of formations has never simply been an exercise in calculating how many men you ’ ve got left as compared to when you started .\\nAnd the increasing saliency of hardware over the millennia has added significant complexity and nuance to proceedings .\\nIndeed , speaking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a tank , say , to be destroyed for it to be removed from the tally of ‘ intact ’ elements .\\nA perhaps ( un ) surprisingly high quotient of Allied armour in the later Second World War was rendered combat-ineffective via mechanical problems or damage to other systems such as the main gun .\\nThis obviously meant that it would be less- or even un-able to participate in its intended role , and therefore in that sense , sure , combat power of its parent unit is degraded .\\nExcept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tank being destroyed outright – and a tank not being present for a phase of operations due to something which is repairable and which sees it back at the front in the not-too-distant future .\\nSo no , no 5 % of Russian combat power no longer being “ intact ” does not mean one in twenty Russian troops deployed to Ukraine are currently dead or wounded .\\nAlthough I have no doubt that in some formations there will indeed have been significant casualties .\\nIn fact , that ’ s one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall picture people are drawing from all of this .\\nRussian VDV operations in the early days of the conflict saw … very high losses of men and material – and were , as we had remarked at the time , frankly bizarre that they had been attempted in the manner involved .\\nThe losses during the ultimately unsuccessful attempt to seize Antonov airbase ( Hostomel ) at the start of the invasion are unconfirmed , but near-certain to have been significant given its recapture by the Ukrainians .\\nA similar pattern appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this is before we consider the Ukrainian claim of having downed two Russian Il-76 transports , at least one of which was reportedly carrying a full contingent of paratroopers .\\nWhy I say that these may have been ‘ distortionary ’ – is because those are … not insignificant losses , entailing several hundred men and associated equipment , suffered in the first two to three days .\\nWhich , if you ’ re just looking at total figures overall , may lead to unwarranted presumptions as to how things have gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other point which is vital to make is that a 5 % loss of combat power over fifteen days of intensive military operations for an attacker is … not unexpected .\\nParticularly given many of the current battlezones are located in and around urban areas , terrain where offensive operations are notoriously costly .\\nHence , of course , the frequent preference of modern militaries to engage in sustained aerial , artillery and/or missile bombardment of such places prior to – or even in lieu of – a direct ground assault .\\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ s efforts during the 2003 Invasion of Iraq may prove interestingly instructive – with , at its height , an oft-quoted figure of 1,700 aerial bombing and missile strikes in a single day carried out largely against urban-proximate targets ; and sustained use of both conventional and cluster munitions persisting for days after that .\\nOf course , the British , American , Australian , etc .\\nactions must be contextualized – the idea having been to minimize Coalition casualties not so much through simply producing a flattened battlespace , as both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crux of the so-called “ Shock And Awe ” doctrine ) and carrying out destruction of particular targets ( potentially including one Al Jazeera office in Baghdad ) in ways which did not therefore ( at least .. in theory ) necessitate the direct involvement of ground troops .\\nThe reason that these instances are instructive , is because they represent a fundamentally different approach to what we have seen from the Russians in Ukraine – thus far .\\nThere have most certainly been both aerial and artillery bombardments of urban areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these have not been at the scale and scope anticipated of them for a hypothetical ‘ full scale ’ war .\\nWhich is not to suggest that these attacks are not serious nor highly destructive – only to emphasize that the Russians would doctrinally be almost expected to be far more so in these regards ( particularly in terms of the usage of artillery as a primary force vector ) .\\nOne explanation which has been advanced by some Western analysts is that the seeming low scale of Russian aerial bombardment sorties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part of the Russian air force to actually carry out complex and frequent combat air operations .\\nThis is clearly incorrect , as the relatively recent Russian record in Syria ( which featured in some cases over a hundred sorties a day , and an average in the 40s ) amply demonstrates .\\nIt might be tempting to presume that the smaller involvement of Russian air power in Ukraine as compared to Syria may be due to concerns about the relative strength of Ukraine ’ s remaining anti-air capacity – however this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the full answer .\\nInstead , I would contemplate whether the seemingly ‘ scaled back ’ deployment of Russian air power might stem from the same reason that their use of artillery has appeared likewise to be less prominent ( although steadily increasing ) .\\nNamely , that their initial invasion approach was something of an opposite one to the American-led ‘ Shock And Awe ’ ethos .\\nAlbeit , it would seem , still possessing a certain element of that same “ we ’ ll be greeted as liberators ” decidedly wishful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observation of the fairly direct consequences of Western militaries ’ enthusiasm for bombardments ( i.e .\\n– a marked uptick in the ordinary people who now have a very , very good reason to choose to become insurgents , considerably frustrating a long-term occupation effort ) or out of a desire to avoid the overwhelmingly negative PR which comes with utilizing highly destructive weaponry in built-up civilian-inhabited areas , the Russians appear to have ‘ held back ’ [ a very , very relative term indeed ] somewhat on these approaches , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assets .\\nSomething which seems to have cost them a fair amount of that 5 % we started out this piece discussing , partially explicating their seeming shift toward greater employment of artillery currently .\\nIn closing , I feel it is useful to draw attention to the two tables that I ’ ve attached here as an image .\\nThey ’ re from relatively outdated ( but still useful ) US Army internal documents , and as you can see they discuss anticipated losses ( both combat and otherwise ) in various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( up to five days ) and longer timescales – measured in daily and monthly casualty rates respectively .\\nNow , 1959 ( when these were published ) is a long while ago , and it can be fairly argued that warfare ’ s changed in a number of ways over that time ( in particular , improvements in battlefield medicine improving survivability … as weighed against ever more lethal weaponry ) .\\nFurther , these figures were likely the result of US analysis of the then relatively recent experiences of World War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to say , conflicts often characterized by ‘ parity ’ or ‘ near-parity ’ opponents … even if specific engagements within either could be decidedly otherwise .\\nYet while it can definitely be asserted that at the strategic level , Ukraine and Russia are decidedly not ‘ parity ’ opponents – in terms of the forces that were sent into Ukraine , the relative disparity in various areas between them and their opponents is arguably much smaller .\\nI therefore suspect that , as a very rough guide , there may yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here .\\nSo , assuming that the American Department of Defense is reasonably accurate in their assessment that Russia had ‘ only ’ retained approximately 95 % of the combat power it has brought to bear in Ukraine … after fifteen days of offensive operations , I am not sure that a 5 % reduction in overall combat power – which , again , does not equate to a 5 % figure for casualties amidst the invaders – is actually that unexpected .\\nIndeed , juxtaposed against the sentiment which has seemingly taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow actually win this war based on how things look from tiktok videos shared to social media , it may seem seriously surprising to some that the figures are not much higher .\\nConcordantly , given the serious scale of the Russian invasion force , some might also suggest that even 5 % of that being out of the fight ( one way or another ) should present a truly staggering amount of manpower and material to have been lost or incapacitated over just over a two week period .\\nFrom our individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nYet that is what modern , conventional warfare regularly entails – and more .\\nI would say “ it is well that it is so rare , then ” – except given current events both there in Ukraine , as well as the numerous smaller-scale conflicts also going on elsewhere ( Yemen , for example ) , it is worth noting that the ‘ rarity ’ is a decidedly localized phenomenon .',\n",

will only hasten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labour Party .\\nBy positioning itself alongside National and Act , Labour would be abandoning the quest for transformational change to the Greens and Te Pāti Māori .\\nMore seriously , Labour would be setting itself upon a course that could only end in the sort of Grand Coalitions that destroyed the German Social-Democratic Party as a force for progressive change .\\nRefusing to accept the need for radical changes might delay transformation , but conservative political resistance can not prevent it from happening .\\nThe priority for any genuine party of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes place in a context that expands the realm of human freedom – rather than constricting it .\\nHence the urgent need for Labour to sit down with the Greens and Te Pāti Māori and sort out who does what in the formulation , presentation and implementation of a truly transformational programme .\\nCrucial to this process will be the identification of new sources of information and advice .\\nA new societal agenda will require a new delivery mechanism : a creative and constantly changing constellation of “ action groups ” modelled on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urgent challenges of Māori vaccination against Covid-19 .\\nRather than policy-making being held within the narrow confines of the neoliberal mandarinate , Labour , the Greens and Te Pati Māori need to seek out the ideas and methodologies of individuals and groups hitherto regarded as operating beyond the realm of “ realistic ” policy formation .\\nPeople and institutions able to begin immediately – utilising expertise and energies undreamt of by the official organs of the state .\\nA government committed to saying “ yes ” before it says “ no ” , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initiatives that have already demonstrated their ability to expand organically from one area of need to another , increasing in complexity and effectiveness as they grow .\\nChange could thus emerge like crops in the fields – from the ground up .\\nRather than congratulate itself for expanding the size of the state bureaucracy , a transformational Labour/Green/ Te Pāti Māori government would measure its success by the number of public servants it liberated from the crushing surveillance and soul-destroying discipline of the neoliberal administrative apparatus .\\nInstead of sucking-up and taming organisational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be to let it fall like windborne seeds into the fertile chaos of the revolution welling-up from below .\\nAs the wiser sort of trade union leader used to say : “ Keep your experts on tap – not on top.\\n” If the recent protest encampment on Parliament Grounds had anything positive to offer the rest of New Zealand , then it was , surely , the example of people held together by a common cause , and how they managed themselves in ways that owed nothing to state or local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ s needs were supplied by those with the skills and resources required to meet them was genuinely inspiring .\\nMotivated by a worthier cause : fighting climate change ;

       "  'content': 'HOW TO PROMOTE a radical left-wing agenda when so few people today can even imagine such a thing ?\\nThe emancipatory impulse that guided so many of the left-wing programmes of the past has almost entirely faded away .\\nIn its place we find a denunciatory political culture .\\nFar too many contemporary leftists are driven by the desire to condemn and punish .\\nWhere once the Left ’ s purpose was to create a better world , its chief preoccupation today appears to be making it a less evil one .\\nA more realistic goal , some might say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reducing evil rests upon the dismal presupposition that evil is humanity ’ s resting state .\\nStriving to reduce the severity of the planet ’ s daily torments is not at all the same as believing it is possible to overcome them .\\nDirecting one ’ s efforts towards making humanity ’ s prison more bearable , differs fundamentally from a project dedicated to reducing that prison to rubble and setting its prisoners free .\\nAs the Second Wave of Feminism swept across the Western World in the early 1970s , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of patriarchy and the emergence of not only a new kind of woman , but also of a new kind of man .\\nThey argued persuasively that the bloody re-ordering of male hierarchies – which men liked to call “ revolutions ” – were not revolutions at all .\\nThe only revolution worthy of the name , they argued , would be the one that brought the full emancipation of women .\\nOnly when the 10,000 year-old patriarchal system of sexual and gender repression was no more , could real human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many of those fiery tongues have been stilled .\\nAs The Platform ’ s Ani O ’ Brien wrote on 8 March , International Women ’ s ’ Day : “ In New Zealand – and perhaps elsewhere – International Women ’ s Day has become a farcical parade of corporate pink-washing overlaid by a nepotistic circle-jerk of privileged and influential liberal ( mostly white ) women giving each other awards at champagne breakfasts [ ….. ] And the issues they focus on ?\\nUsually not particularly high on the priority list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not for those who are under-privileged.\\n” On matters of race the picture is equally depressing .\\nSticking with our earlier prison metaphor , the attention of the Contemporary Left seems fixated upon the ideas and actions of the prison guards , and how important it is to make them understand the enormously harmful impact of their prejudices and practices upon the well-being of the prisoners .\\nIf the purpose of “ re-educating ” these oppressors was to persuade them to make common cause with the oppressed , then its inherent negativity might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not its goal .\\nThe ambitions of the Contemporary Left do not extend beyond ensuring that the guards and the prisoners administer the prison together – “ partners ” in penology .\\nWhen it comes to issues of class , the picture is even bleaker .\\nIn tragic contrast to the leftists of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries , the Contemporary Left seem mortally afraid of offending the boss .\\nThe very notion that “ the history of all hitherto existing societies is the history of class struggle ” strikes them as decidedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Managerial Class , whose task it is to administer capitalism smoothly , with a minimum of fuss , on behalf of the people who own it , the Contemporary Left has taught itself to look at the working-class and see … nothing .\\nWithout the determination to emancipate , the Left has no ability to inspire .\\nLacking the stimulus of their common advancement , the political inertness of “ the people ” is only to be overcome by outrage .\\nBy exposing the wickedness and brutality of those who wield power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anger .\\nRather than the emancipatory programmes spawned by the Old Left ’ s creative political imaginings , the Contemporary Left offers the marginalised and oppressed only the sterile alternatives of condemnation and punishment .\\nThe “ Me Too ” movement replaces the New Woman and the New Man .\\n“ Black Lives Matter ” replaces Martin Luther King ’ s “ I have a dream !\\n” The problem with constantly parading wickedness and brutality before people ’ s gaze is that pretty soon they begin to think that ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrive at the dismal conclusion that the condemners and the punishers are not only fighting a never-ending battle , but a losing one .\\nFor every Harvey Weinstein and Jeffrey Epstein who falls , countless other abusers will go unpunished .\\nFor every racist cop that gets put away , a thousand more contrive to hide their racism more carefully .\\nNot only are these conclusions depressing , they ’ re scary .\\nOrdinary folk begin to ask themselves : if the urge to condemn and punish is all that now drives the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to go shut down and/or shut up the bad guys ?\\nNot many people are happy with the idea of living in a society where citizens have to weigh carefully every word and action , or fall victim to a regime in which punishment is the first resort , and forgiveness the swiftest path to ruin .\\nAbandon the Left ’ s quest for emancipation in favour of the politics of denunciation , and what is left to the ordinary citizen but material aspiration ?\\nIf building a better world is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and this one is dominated by forces against which the Left fights and fights but never overcomes ; then surely the only sensible course of action is for individuals and families to get and keep as much as they can while the getting and keeping is good ?\\nFor the past thirty-five years this is the only consistent message the New Zealand electorate has been sent .\\nCertainly , it is the message which the National Party never tires of sending to voters .\\nThe Old Labour Left ( think Mickey Savage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanting to upset the settled order of things – a prospect which the comfortably situated can always be relied upon to abhor .\\nThe New Labour Left ( think Helen Clark and Jacinda Ardern ) National condemns for its puritanical obsession with punishing the sins that make comfort possible .\\n( The Greens are even worse ! )\\nSince the Old Labour Left died with the Alliance twenty years ago , and the current incarnation of the Greens regards its policies as ideologically suspect relics of a bygone age , the New Labour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a manifesto in which the impulse to confront and overcome the evils of the status quo is blended with a determination to emancipate its victims .\\nEvil can only be vanquished by the creation of a world in which it can not thrive .\\nPersuading the voters that this is true is no easy task .\\nIt requires a political party that never stops making the case for radical change .\\nSadly , no such party exists in the New Zealand of today .\\nOffer voters a radical left-wing agenda in 2022 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiasm , but a mixture of doubt and scorn .\\nAs in this comment from a former National Party Cabinet Minister : “ Is it really credible that Labour will become akin to a Corbynite party , since that is effectively what is being suggested .\\nIf they did , and that was clearly signalled before the election , I reckon you could pretty much guarantee Labour a few years in the political wilderness to contemplate the consequences of such a decision .\\n“ There is simply no appetite in New Zealand for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no accident that the biggest selling vehicles are double-cab utes capable of pulling the 6 meter fishing boat [ which is , in ] fact , owned by the PM ’ s partner along with the beach house in Tairua .\\nThe epitome of the kiwi dream .\\n“ Just about every single policy dreamed up by such a fanciful radical coalition would be diametrically opposed to people being able to fulfil such a dream .\\n“ The party that actually trumpet the opportunity to fulfil such a dream are much more likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these times is that Jacinda Ardern ’ s Labour Party would almost certainly agree .\\nAnd the even bigger tragedy – so would 98 percent of the voters .',\n",

Why , with all the hopeful possibilities engendered by the end of the cold war , should East-West relations become centered on the question of who would be allied with whom and , by implication , against whom in some fanciful , totally unforeseeable and most improbable future military conflict ?\\nBefore the invasion , Ukraine had become a defacto member of Nato with hundreds of millions of dollars in arms flowing into the country , along with constant military training and exercises with Nato forces on Ukraine soil .\\nEscalating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Ukraine President are simply reckless and foolish .\\nIt would lead to an immediate nuclear standoff and possible incineration of the Ukraine and much of the rest of the world .\\nWhen the old USSR and allied Warsaw Pact folded in the early 1990s the nations that gained their independence suffered an horrific economic and social decline .\\nGDP fell by up to two-thirds and fife expectancy often declined .\\nThe old state-owned industries were essentially handed out to the new governing elite to become the new “ oligarchs ” .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ people felt betrayed at the that the nirvana promised by capitalism never eventuated .\\nThe USSR and Eastern Europe had a false version of “ Communism ” attached to their economic and social structure .\\nThere was essentially free-education , free health care and a guarantee of a job which are associated with “ socialist ” policies .\\nBut alongsed that , was an extreme authoritarianism and bureaucratic mismanagement .\\nThe elites in this system welcomed the transition to capitalism because it gave them wealth on a scale that couldn ’ t be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that wealth on to their children .\\nBut the new elites had no common purpose or vision for their societies .\\n“ Greed is Good ” only goes so far .\\nThe oligarchs were forced to sponsor political and social movements that were based on “ identities ” like ethnicity rather than class or social interests .\\nNationalism and ethnic exclusiveness became the common denominator .\\nRight-wing , fascist ideologies became common throughout the states that restored market economies .\\nA religious attachment to free-market fundamentalist ideology went with that since they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and social solidarity became ostracised and labelled as a new socialist or communist demon to be driven out .\\nThat was true for Ukraine as much as for Russia .\\nUkraine is effectively a colony of the US .\\nThe IMF uses the debts Ukraine was forced to accept as a lever to carry through the free-market economic policies successive governments have tried to implement .\\nThe ability of US agricultural big business to buy agricultural lands is being been pushed through by current government despite widespread opposition .\\nIf people genuinely want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should support the abolition of its debts to the IMF , World Bank , European and US banks .\\nthe chance to join the European Union ( and Nato ) has been held up as a carrot by the West to attract support from people in the Ukraine who desperately want to escape the economic nightmare they have been in .\\nThis is popular with many working people also because if they were let in workers would have the right to work throughout Europe .\\nUkrainians now largely replace the Poles and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it was never a realistic option .\\nUkraine has a GDP per capita less than $ 4000 US dollars .\\nIt was never going to get the right to subsidies to help make up the gap between $ 4000 and $ 44,000 in the EU .\\nNor was a nation of 45 million and a labour market of 21 million going to get work rights across the EU .\\nThe people of Ukraine have been cheated and lied to the get them to serve as foot soldiers by the US and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace in the world we need to advance class and social solidarity internationally .\\nThat means an international defense of all nations right to self-determination – not just friends of the United States .\\nThe problem at the moment with any attempt to hold a country to account for breaching international law is that the US refuses the jurisdiction of the World Court and will veto any criticism of itself ( or close allies like Israel ) at the UN Security Council .\\nThe US is also the only nation in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war wherever and whenever it so desires .\\nSteps towards world peace , means removing the veto power of the nuclear states at the UN Security Council .\\nIt means pushing for universal nuclear disarmament seriously .\\nNato-led war in Afghanistan ( 2000 ) and Iraq ( 2003 ) followed .\\nNew Zealand is now a “ partner ’ ” at Nato .\\nFor what reason ?\\nAs one of the allies of the US who helped the US destroy then abandon the country , and then has stayed silent about this theft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repsonsibility for these deaths to come .\\nThe world must eliminate the ability of the US to impose cruel economic sanctions on nations it dislikes unilaterally – as it has today against Cuba , Venezuela , North Korea , Syria , Iran , Russia , China and many others .\\nThe US also imposes these sanctions with extra-terratorial force .\\nThis means Kiwbank in NZ is too scared to give the Ambassador of Cuba a credit card even through NZ has good relations with Cuba !\\nSteps towards world peace , means removing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions of the World Court like when it was found guilty for blockading Nicaragua ’ s ports .\\nThe only times I support sanctions are when that it the expressed will of the people of a country – as demanded by the people of South Africa and Palestine .\\nOtherwise sanctions are always a weapon of the rich and powerful against the poor .\\nIt is working people not oligarchs who will lose out .\\nAlthough The current sanctions against Russia seem designed to collapse the economy .\\nThis is not just targeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a disaster not to Putin or the oligarchs but to working people in Russia and the Ukraine and the world .\\nContinuing the economic war on Russia wil cause food and energy prices to explode across the globe , Millions will die of hunger as a direct consequence .\\nThe war in the Ukraine must end .\\nRussian military forces must be withdrawn , Whatever compromises are needed are a brutal fact of life but are justified if the world can achieve an end to the war .\\nThe wars must end and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end .\\nNZ must end its military and political alliances with the old imperialist powers ( US , UK , Europe

Asia , Africa and Latin America .',\n",

receipts required ) .\\nAll of these things must be done before you can be registered by the Electoral Commission as a political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ’ ve got to be a registered political party before you can field electorate candidates and/or lodge a Party List .\\nWhat a load of bullshit !\\nHow is people ’ s freedom protected by forcing them to jump through all these bureaucratic hoops ?\\nObviously , it just a way of dampening the ardour and deflecting the energy of free individuals .\\nYou don ’ t have to be Albert Einstein to see that the moment your movement agrees to adhere to the Electoral Commissions rules and regulations , the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Factions form .\\nFactional leaders appear .\\nFactional strife erupts .\\nThe most ruthless and thick-skinned bastards in your movement end up running the show .\\nYou ’ re fucked before you ’ ve even begun to raise money and trudge the streets in search of votes .\\nWhich is exactly what the Powers That Be intended all

drag as in fake .\\nBut drag as in something which slows everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which slows down or – even worse – actively impedes the operations of the free market .\\nThat ’ s why Neoliberals do everything within their power to make “ government of the people , by the people , for the people ” a practical impossibility .\\nStrip the people ’ s representatives of their power to interfere in

electoral process , for whom Democracy has come to feel like a huge and heavy collection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compelled to drag behind us .\\nEvery general election it ’ s the same .\\nThe political parties lay out their wares before us in the political marketplace .\\nWe lay down our money and we make our choice .\\nIf we ’ re lucky our party wins .\\nIf it loses , we shrug and say “ there ’ s always next time ” .\\nThe problem , though , is that , win or lose , nothing ever seems to get better .\\nNo matter which party occupies the Treasury Benches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harder and harder .\\nThere was a time – or so the history books tell us – when the promises of politicians meant something .\\nEvery three years the parties would issue manifestos stuffed with policies which , if they won the election , they would implement .\\nThe parties themselves were large organisations , with thousands of members , and political mechanisms for translating their wishes into policies , and policy into law .\\nIt wasn ’ t a perfect system , but it worked well enough to keep people believing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exactly when it all started to go wrong is difficult to pinpoint – although there are some who identify the election of 1984 as the beginning of Democracy ’ s decline in New Zealand .\\nThey point to the fact that what Labour put in its manifesto bore absolutely no resemblance to the policy revolution unleashed upon the country by David Lange and his Finance Minister , Roger Douglas .\\nNew Zealanders were told that there was no alternative to the Labour Government ’ s “ reforms ” – which must have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ t both to publish a manifesto at all .\\nOthers say that the rot really set in in 1990 .\\nTired of Labour ’ s reforms , nearly half the country turned to the National Party ’ s Jim Bolger who was promising to restore “ The Decent Society ” that Labour had destroyed .\\nExcept that , even before all the votes had been counted , National began to break its promises .\\nInstead of The Decent Society , New Zealand got “ The Mother of All Budgets ” .\\nMore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Much worse .\\nDemocracy no longer seemed to work , but the people could neither repair it nor improve it .\\nThey tried .\\nNew Zealanders abandoned First-Past-the-Post for Mixed Member Proportional .\\nBut , if anything , that only made matters worse .\\nThe decisiveness of governments elected under FPP , the power to keep their promises , was swapped out for government by coalitions , which , as everybody knows , can only ever be as honest as their most deceitful members .\\nPromises no longer mattered , because no party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , or , at least , not all of them .\\nUntil the election of 2020 , when , in recognition of its superb handling of the

that we are forced to drag behind us .\\nIt ’ s a sad story , but the saddest part of all is how easy it would be for the right person , using the right words , to persuade us to cut the traces connecting us to our democratic burden – and simply let it go .',\n",

       "  'content': 'ACADEMIC FREEDOM is one of those “ public goods ” that most people seldom question .\\nEven in New Zealand , a country not especially hospitable to intellectuals of any sort , academics are seldom identified as persons in need of official restraint .\\nNew Zealanders prefer to joke about the otherworldliness and impracticality of academic research – especially in the social sciences and liberal arts .\\nThat is to say , they used to joke about it .\\nOver the last few years academics have given ordinary New Zealanders small cause for laughter .\\nIndeed , it has become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , along with many other advocates of freedom of expression , that the place where academic freedom is most at risk is , paradoxically , academia itself .\\nThe banning of Don Brash from the Palmerston North campus of Massey University – by no lesser person than the Vice-Chancellor herself – was one of the most dramatic early examples .\\nThere have been many others .\\nNot the least of these was the initial failure of the University of Auckland to defend the seven members of its own academic staff who dared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NZ Listener , that Mātaurānga Māori was not Science .\\nWhile paying lip-service to the principle of academic freedom , New Zealand ’ s university authorities have begun to hedge it around with all manner of restrictions .\\nThe pursuit of research subjects and/or the articulation of ideas capable of inflicting “ harm ” on other staff and students has become decidedly “ career-limiting ” To discover exactly how pervasive this revisionist approach to academic freedom has become , and to identify how many academics still uphold freedom of expression , the Free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a representative cross section of the New Zealand academic community .\\nThat survey is ongoing , but one of the responses received was so startling that the FSU posted it on its website .\\nThis is what it said : Please remove me from your e-mail list .\\nFreedom is an archaic feudal principal ( sic ) employed by colonial capitalism to advance the upward mobility of the few and maintain the status quo , and I do not subscribe to it .\\nIt is important to bear in mind that the person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the academic staff of a New Zealand university .\\nSomeone bound by the terms of their employment to uphold the highest standards of scholarship .\\nSomeone who is almost certainly lecturing to and/or tutoring young New Zealanders .\\nSomeone who , by their own admission , does not subscribe to the principle of freedom .\\nLet us begin by unpacking the anonymous respondent ’ s declaration .\\nThe first observation to make is that the his/her understanding of both European and New Zealand history is entirely untethered from reality .\\nTo begin with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of freedom , but of reciprocity .\\nIn the fiercely hierarchical societies of the medieval period even those at the summit of the social pyramid owed a duty of care and protection to those whose status was inferior to their own .\\nThose at the bottom , far from being free , were legally tied to their lord ’ s land .\\nMale dependents of the lord were also expected to fight for him when required to do so .\\nWhat the serfs ( as these dependents were called ) received in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lord ’ s land provided , as well as military and legal protection against those seeking to harm them .\\nIn certain rare circumstances a serf might be released from his obligations , thereby becoming a “ freed ” man .\\nWith nobody now obligated to care for him , however , such a person faced a difficult future .\\nUnless he was especially gifted , a freed man would hasten to “ bind ” himself to another lord or master .\\nClearly , feudalism and freedom are not concepts one usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact .\\nWhat about “ colonial capitalism ” ?\\nIs it legitimate to associate the capitalist economic system with feudalism and freedom ?\\nHistorically speaking , capitalism is the economic system that dissolved feudalism , along with the aristocratic political system it sustained .\\nRather than a society founded upon hierarchy and mutual obligation , capitalism gave rise to a society based upon the freedom of the individual to enter into contracts with other individuals – for money .\\nIf you were inventive , clever , or just plain lucky , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you had nothing to offer but your unskilled labour , then the contracts entered into generally offered little more than the barest subsistence .\\nIn the context of New Zealand ’ s colonisation , however , a persistent shortage of skilled – and unskilled – labour offered working-class colonists a considerably better existence than the one they were escaping on the immigrant ships .\\nAt least initially , it wasn ’ t freedom that underpinned the growth of the colony , but the prospect of a more prosperous and open-ended life – which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zealanders ’ interest in political freedom grew out of the failure of the colony ’ s rulers to ensure that opportunity and prosperity remained a realistic prospect for the ordinary colonist .\\nA large part of that failure was attributable to the difficulty encountered by the colonial authorities in acquiring sufficient land from the Māori to keep the New Zealand enterprise going .\\nIt was precisely the freedom to contract , or not to contract , with the Crown in respect to the sale of land – a freedom guaranteed by the Treaty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the consternation and rising fury of the settler government ) by the Kingitanga and its allies , that caused the British Crown to make war upon the Māori .\\nIf anyone was defending freedom in 1860s New Zealand it was the tangata whenua .\\nIn making war upon the Māori , the colonial capitalists and their servants in the colonial legislature were not defending the status quo , they were tearing it – and the Treaty of Waitangi – to pieces .\\nTheir legal justification for seizing Māori land had nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but to archaic English laws pertaining to rebellion against the Crown .\\nFeudal laws .\\nWhat ’ s more , the seizure of Māori land did not advance the upward mobility of wealthy capitalists alone .\\nThousands of Pakeha colonists benefitted from the parcelling-out of the territories seized , mostly in the form of leased small-holdings – later translated into freehold farms .\\nIt was the Pakeha many who prospered , and the Māori few who were dispossessed .\\nIt is hard to see how this great wrong can ever be righted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no subscribers among the tangata whenua .\\nHarder still to see such a rectification being accomplished where the research and intellectual labour needed to convince a majority of New Zealanders that change is necessary is not rigorously monitored , or the fierce debates it sparks given the freest rein .\\nAcademic freedom must amount to more than protecting ignorance and sanctioning disinformation .\\nThe simple truth of the matter is that freedom is always and everywhere indivisible .\\nSuppress it in our universities and its suppression elsewhere will soon follow .\\nThose who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in our halls of learning – or anywhere else enlightened human values are cherished .',\n",

unfortunately , remains narrowly focused ( Sky Television has even banned RT ‘ Russia Today ’ from broadcasting on its network ) and largely ignores the ominously growing lack of respect for human rights and international law on all sides .\\nRefugees elsewhere are losing more recognition now than ever before , and those responsible for their suffering hide behind hypocritical pronouncements of concern .\\nEarlier this month , US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanded that the UN Human Rights Council strip Russia of its UNHRC membership while later denouncing the Council ‘ s investigations into Israel ‘ s inhumanities against the Palestinian people as “ a stain on the council ’ s credibility ” .\\nUNHRC investigations have found Israel responsible for persistent human rights violation , including “ the

prejudice and , according to The National Geographic , had collaborated with the Nazi Occupiers : “ According to German historian Dieter Pohl , around 100,000 joined police units that provided key assistance to the Nazis.\\n” Many others staffed the local bureaucracies or lent a helping hand during mass shootings of Jewish people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among guards who manned the Nazi death camps .\\nAs the German Army made its retreat from Ukraine , near the end of the war , the Ukrainian Insurgent Army and some nationalist units and partisan groups killed Jews attempting to hide in the forests

Unexpectedly , Ukrainian and Palestinian refugees have suddenly appeared on-stage together .\\nJewish Voice for Peace ( JVP ) has condemned the Israeli Government ‘ s welcoming of Jewish refugees from

Palestinian refugees to return to their homes .\\nWhen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea is governed by , and in the interests of , all of its citizens then others of any religion can apply to immigrate.\\n” In Ukraine , people of colour seeking refuge are also being ill-treated .\\nThe American weekly magazine Newsweek reports that people from Ukraine ’ s population of at least 20,000 black academics , medical students , professionals and refugees trying to flee the Russian invasion have been “ manhandled ” and “ routinely told to get to the back of the line.\\n” Likewise , Huffpost has reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facing racist treatment as they seek to flee cities under attack .\\nBlack people are being kept from boarding buses and trains , even though white Ukrainians have been able to .\\nEven the United Nations ’ High Commissioner for refugees , Filippo Grandi , recognised the “ different treatment ” .\\nThe French television news network , euronews , also notes that , “ while international praise is heaped upon countries like Romania , Hungary and Poland for accepting asylum seekers from Ukraine , not all refugees are being welcomed with open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people being stopped at the border queues to neighbouring nations and being turned away completely .\\nProfessor Ziad Majed notes that there is a “ shocking distinction between Ukrainian citizens and refugees from the Middle East.\\n” The Independent quotes a Nigerian national : “ When I look into the eyes of those who are turning us away , I see bloodshot racism.\\n” Within days of the invasion of Ukraine , Western

       "  'content': 'THERE HAS TO BE something wrong with us .\\nIt ’ s the only explanation that makes sense .\\nSome sickness of mind and spirit that blinds us to our own extraordinary hypocrisy .\\nThe hypocrisy on display in relation to the Solomon Islands ’ proposed security agreement with the Chinese is , however , beyond astounding .\\nIndeed , with the attention of the world focused so intently on Russia ’ s invasion of Ukraine , the reaction of our own government , and those of New Zealand ’ s friends and allies , is scarcely believable .\\nWhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire Western World is denouncing in Ukraine ?\\nIs it not the idea , expounded by the Russians , that Ukraine is located within the Russian Federation ’ s sphere of influence , and that its oft-expressed desire to join Nato constitutes a clear and present threat to Russia ’ s national security ?\\nHave not the Russians repeatedly denounced the extension of Nato ’ s military reach to the very borders of their Federation ?\\nDo they not present this as conclusive evidence of the West ’ s predatory designs upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian state ?\\nAnd has not the West rejected Russia ’ s claims ?\\nMost particularly , has it not rejected the notion that it is any longer acceptable to speak about nations having “ spheres of influence ” ?\\nIs the West ’ s vehement condemnation of Russia ’ s invasion of Ukraine not based upon the principle that nation states have an inalienable right to determine their own destinies ?\\nThe governments of all the Western powers , including our own , are doing everything within their power , short of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ukraine , and to punish the Russian Federation for violating the territorial integrity and national sovereignty of an independent nation state and United Nations member by an act of military aggression .\\nThe Australian Government has been loud in its condemnation of Russia – as has its news media – and yet , just a few days ago , the following opinions were given wide coverage by the Rupert Murdoch-owned News.com.au under the headline : “ Australia ‘ must ready Solomon Islands invasion ’ to stop China security deal ” .\\nAccording to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former owner of The Diplomat , a journal dedicated to Asia-Pacific affairs , the coming into full effect of the proposed security pact between the Solomon Islands and the Peoples Republic of China would mean “ the effective end of [ Australia ’ s ] sovereignty and democracy ” .\\n“ There is no way that Australia can allow this deal to proceed ” wrote Llewellyn-Smith .\\n“ If it must , the nation should invade and capture Guadalcanal such that we engineer regime change in Honiara .\\nThere are other soft power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull them forcefully .\\nBut we should also immediately begin amassing an amphibious invasion force to add pressure.\\n” If it was put to Llewellyn-Smith that his own reasoning is identical to that of Vladimir Putin , he would , almost certainly , reject the comparison .\\nAnd yet , he is proposing to engineer regime change in the Solomon Island ’ s capital , Honiara , by invading and capturing Guadalcanal – the island in which the city is situated .\\nThe difference between Llewellyn-Smith ’ s proposal and Putin ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ukraine and capturing its capital city , Kyiv , is extremely difficult to discern .\\nAnd , just in case , we feel tempted to dismiss these sentiments as the rantings of yet another bellicose Australian pundit , with which that increasingly belligerent country seems infested , New Zealand ’ s very own Professor Anne Marie Brady has told RNZ ’ s “ Mid-Day Report ” host , Māni Dunlop , that : “ the draft agreement to station military forces on Solomon Islands could see the South Pacific cut off and encircled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview reveals just how deeply the instincts of Western imperialism are embedded in New Zealand ’ s foreign affairs community .\\nAccording to the University of Canterbury professor , the Solomon Islands represent a “ failed state ” , riddled with corruption and Chinese influence-peddling , problems with which , in spite of 14 years of Australian and New Zealand military occupation in the guise of the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands ( RAMSI ) its political class is still plagued .\\nAccordingly , it can only benefit from stepped-up “ assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ friends ” .\\nLike a good Kiwi , Brady shies away from Llewellyn-Smith ’ s call for a return to the gunboat diplomacy of the Nineteenth century .\\nBut , quite how the deal with China can be stopped short of resorting to the use of force and/or rampant Anzac influence-peddling and corruption , the professor does not say .\\nWhat makes Brady ’ s intervention even more interesting is her connections with a research-project-cum-think-tank known as SSANSE – “ Small States and the New Security Environment ” .\\nAs The Daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SSANES was/is based in Iceland and was/is at least partially funded by Nato .\\nBrady ’ s assessment of New Zealand ’ s strategic predicament back in 2020 was nothing if not dramatic : “ The global environment has not been so challenging for New Zealand since 1942 when British forces in Singapore , who were New Zealand ’ s shield , fell to the advance of the Japanese .\\nNew Zealand must now face up to the national security risk of the Covid-19 outbreak .\\nThe current situation poses a risk not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for our Pacific , Five Eyes and NATO partners , as well as like-minded states who uphold the international rules-based order.\\n” That “ international rules-based order ” is , presumably the same order which has encouraged the rest of the world to declare economic war on the Russian Federation in retaliation for its illegal invasion of Ukraine .\\nOnly time will tell whether that very same order will demand the imposition of equally swingeing sanctions on Australia and New Zealand should they “ invade and capture Guadalcanal ” in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since neither Canberra nor Wellington would dare contemplate such an action without the endorsement of “ our Pacific , Five Eyes and NATO partners ” , it is reasonably safe to conclude that it would not .\\nIt might be wise , however , for the likes of Llewellyn-Smith and Brady to ask themselves whether China might not be playing an extremely clever game here .\\nThinking about it , what better demonstration of Western hypocrisy could there be than a frankly imperialist and racist re-imposition of Five Eyes control in Honiara to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sphere of influence ” in the Pacific ?\\nHow much easier could the West make it for China to convince all those nations on the receiving end of the “ international rules-based order ” that its rules are meant for “ thee ” but not for “ me ” ?\\nThat while it is an unconscionable violation of international law to invade the territory of people whose skins are white ; it is no more than an act of friendship to invade and capture the islands of people whose skins are brown .',\n",

       "  'content': 'Russia ’ s invasion of Ukraine has exposed so much hypocrisy in Aotearoa New Zealand and around the western world that ’ s it ’ s hard to keep track .\\nIsrael has racism down to a fine art .\\nWhile the world was putting their hand up for Ukrainian refugees – Israel put its hand up only for Jewish Ukrainian refugees ( at least one grandparent must be Jewish ) As early as January 2022 , Israel began planning to transfer Ukrainian Jews to become colonists in the land of the Palestinians .\\nIsrael ’ s Ministry of Aliyah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call on the Jews of Ukraine to immigrate to Israel – your home.\\n” The refugees/colonists began to arrive in early March , receiving preferential treatment , while Ukrainians who could not prove their Jewishness according to Israel ’ s racist criteria for refugees face myriad difficulties .\\nMeanwhile , the World Zionist Organization ’ s Settlement Division has begun preparing 1000 housing units for Ukrainian Jews on stolen and occupied Palestinian and Syrian land in the occupied West Bank and the occupied Golan Heights .\\nWhen there was an outcry from Israeli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was not a reflection of Jewish values , the government said they would take non-Jewish refugees as well .\\nThe predictable reaction from racist Israelis was “ We are a Jewish state – why are we taking in these gentiles ?\\n” .\\nThe government however says the non-Jewish refugees won ’ t be able to claim Israeli citizenship – they will have to leave when the fighting stops .\\nImportant to point out here that Israel is NOT a Jewish state .\\n20 % of Israeli citizens are Palestinians .\\nIsrael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state dominated by a racist regime which has made indigenous Palestinians second , third , fourth , fifth and sixth class inhabitants in the land of their birth and the land of their ancestors , Palestine .\\nThis is well described in Amnesty International ’ s short video on Israeli apartheid .\\nJewish Ukrainian refugees are being welcomed because it helps Israel maintain a majority Jewish population .\\nIt ’ s a country obsessed with demographics and determined to maintain what Israel ’ s largest and most respected Human Right Group , B @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Jewish supremacy from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea ” .\\nIt is proposed that most of the Jewish Ukrainian refuges will be settled in illegal Jewish-only settlements on stolen Palestinian land while Israel ’ s apartheid government continues its refusal to allow Palestinians to return to their homes and land after around 800,000 were ethnically cleansed from vast swathes of Historic Palestine by Israeli militias in 1948 – a process which continues to this day .\\nAnd Jewish Ukrainian refugees will qualify for automatic Israeli citizenship – something denied the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Palestine – all of which has been occupied by the Israeli military since 1967 .\\nMeanwhile Israeli Prime Minister Naftali “ I ’ ve killed a lot of Arabs in my time and there ’ s nothing wrong with that ” Bennett has been promoting himself as an international mediator .\\nIsrael didn ’ t join the international condemnation of Russia and has repeatedly refused Ukrainian appeals for military assistancebut Bennet flew to Moscow for a three-hour meeting with Putin and was then on the phone to Zelensky suggesting to him he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destruction in Ukraine and agree to Russian terms .\\nBennett followed up by trying to get the parties together for a mediation meeting in Jerusalem .\\nThis is the same Israeli leader who refuses to meet with Palestinian leaders , refuses to negotiate any peace deal with Palestinians and says he will never agree to a Palestinian state being established on his watch .\\nNot the credentials for an international mediator .\\nAnd in case readers missed the recent news a further two high-profile groups have joined the international human rights condemnation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short summary of the highest profile groups that have described Israel in this way over the past 18 months is here : • The late South African Archbishop and Nobel Peace prize winner Desmond Tutu “ Name Israel an apartheid state and boycott ” • B ’ Tselem – Israel ’ s largest and most respected human right organisation , in their January 2021 report “ A regime of Jewish supremacy from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea : This is apartheid ” • Human Rights Watch , the US largest human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report “ A Threshold Crossed : Israeli Authorities and the Crimes of Apartheid and Persecution ” • Amnesty International , in their February 2022 report “ Israel ’ s apartheid against Palestinians ” • UN Special Rapporteur to the United Nations Human Right Council , Michael Lynk , Israel has imposed upon Palestine an apartheid reality in a post-apartheid world It ’ s racism on steroids in Israel just as it was in apartheid South Africa .\\nAnd increasingly Jews around the world are seeing it as such .\\nFrom an opinion poll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already regard Israel as an apartheid state and 38 % of young American Jews say the same thing .\\nWe need regime change in Israel and everyone living in historic Palestine enjoying equal rights .',\n",

       "  'content': 'BRIDGERTON has proved to be one of Netflix ’ s most popular productions .\\nIts peculiar combination of history , the lifestyles of the rich and the famous , and identity politics , has captured a substantial chunk of younger Netflix viewers .\\nHow much these younger viewers actually know about the society , economy and politics of Regency England is uncertain – although “ not much ” would be a pretty safe bet .\\nNor can we be certain about how much their understanding of the period has been distorted by Bridgerton – but , on this question , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the correct answer .\\nSo , what is so wrong about Bridgerton ?\\nWhy are these questions about history and its distortion so important ?\\nBluntly , the problem with Bridgerton is that it presents Regency England ( 1811-1820 ) as a nation in which racial diversity is evident everywhere .\\nAll the way from the poorest layers of society to the upper reaches of the English aristocracy , persons of African and Indian heritage are an integral part of their respective communities .\\nSadly , this presentation of England ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also dangerous .\\nIf there really had been Black duchesses in Regency England , then our present-day reality would be entirely different .\\nIn fact , the creative and political impulses behind Bridgerton , if absorbed uncritically , must render any useful understanding of contemporary racism an impossibility .\\nWhen confronted with these criticisms , the creator of Bridgerton , Chris Van Dusen , responded that the drama “ is a reimagined world , we ’ re not a history lesson , it ’ s not a documentary .\\nWhat we ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marrying history and fantasy in what I think is a very exciting way .\\nOne approach that we took to that is our approach to race ” .\\nIn spite of Van Dusen ’ s denials , Bridgerton ’ s narrative appears to be based on the assumption that “ colour-blind casting ” – the assigning of dramatic roles without reference to the actors ’ skin colour – produces an entirely positive set of progressive effects .\\nColour-blind casting means that the discriminatory impact of elevating historical accuracy above equal opportunity is overcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to every performer .\\nThis requires the audience to “ look through ” an actor ’ s skin colour and concentrate instead on the quality of their performance .\\nIdeally , the jarring effect of assigning culturally significant “ white ” roles to people of colour also requires the audience to confront and examine their own racist assumptions and expectations .\\nIf an actor of Indian heritage is cast as Charles Dickens ’ David Copperfield , or a black actress is given the role of Queen Anne Boleyn , and you ’ re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about you ?\\nThe answer , of course , is that your outrage represents an unmistakable manifestation of deep-seated racism .\\nColour-blind casting isn ’ t the problem – you are .\\nExcept that anyone who knows anything about their historical heritage knows full well that no one from the Indian sub-continent could possibly have had the luck of Dickens ’ David Copperfield .\\nEngland in 1840 just wasn ’ t that sort of place .\\nThey ’ d also know that there was absolutely no way a king of England – even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been permitted to marry a “ Moor ” .\\nTo cast Black actors in these roles is a gross distortion of the past .\\nA distortion undertaken in the misguided hope of ameliorating the racism of the present .\\nTo understand the racism embedded in contemporary European societies and their colonial offshoots it is necessary to understand the historical conditions out of which the sickness arose .\\nThat understanding would be greatly assisted if the source of the extraordinary wealth on display in Bridgerton : the grand estates and magnificent mansions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legions of servants ; the great crowds of hangers-on ; was accurately depicted as the fruits of the extraordinary profits of the sugar islands of the West Indies and the hundreds-of-thousands of slaves that were shipped across the Atlantic Ocean to work in the ( very white ) aristocrats ’ obscenely lucrative plantations .\\nThe Prince Regent ( after whom the Regency period is named ) was , of course , the son of the King George III .\\nIt was his father who “ lost ” the thirteen rebellious colonies that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How helpful it would be , therefore , to produce a Netflix drama series whose leading characters hailed from both the slave-owning cotton producers of the American south and the cotton-mill-owners of the English north .\\nHow easy it would be then to expose how the chattel slavery that made America also made English capitalism .\\nHow Uncle Tom ’ s slave-cabin and England ’ s dark satanic mills were always bound together by unbreakable sinews of tortured human flesh .\\nAh , but would such a truthful depiction of the past rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch Netflix really want to be shown the ways in which the horrors of the past drove sharp shards of misery deep into the West ’ s cultural soul .\\nA truthful Bridgerton would explain the European people ’ s desperate need to erase the past .\\nEpisode by episode , it would depict the inevitable psychological projection of their worst impulses on to their victims : the relentless construction of the racial “ other ” .\\nBut that would be a Bridgerton too far .\\nAnd besides , who the hell would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident that Bridgerton ’ s executive producer is Shonda Rhimes , the guiding intelligence behind that other big Netflix hit Inventing Anna .\\nRhimes just “ gets ” the millennial zeitgeist .\\nHistory is what you make up – what you can make people believe .\\nHow ?\\nAs easily as the real Anna Sorokin created the fabulous “ Anna Divey ” ; or , by conjuring up the fantasy of a racially diverse Regency .\\nYou present an historically blank generation with “ realities ” they want to believe in .',\n",

the “ Blue Ocean Continent ” , which , as a mere figure of speech , can not claim the rights of an independent nation state , nor become a member of the United Nations , nevertheless possesses regional sovereign interests of its own .\\nFurther implied , in this new coinage of Mahuta ’ s , is that “ regional sovereignty ” trumps national sovereignty .\\nBluntly : Honiara proposes , but the PIF ( i.e .\\nAustralia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only is this concept new , but it is also profoundly pernicious .\\nWith the undoubted backing of New Zealand ’ s Five Eyes “ partners ” , Mahuta is asserting the right of the Solomon Island ’ s neighbours to determine its foreign and defence policies .\\nA century-and-a-half ago , at the high point of the Age of Imperialism , such an overt curtailment of national sovereignty would have been described as transforming what had formerly been an independent territory into a “ protectorate ” of one or the other of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Solomon ’ s case , the “ protectors ” are the five English-speaking nations which have , since the end of the Second World War , looked upon the Pacific Ocean as an Anglo-Saxon lake .\\nSo much for the “ Pacific resilience ” about which Mahuta boasted in her speech to the NZIIA last November .\\nNew Zealand ’ s foreign minister is openly participating in the restoration of Anglo-Saxon imperialism across the “ Blue Ocean Continent ” – for no better reason than to keep her country ’ s largest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nChina will draw its own conclusions .\\nAnd so , too , if it has any instinct for national self-preservation , will the Solomon Islands .',\n",

       "  'content': 'WATCHING THE NEWS coverage of the Russo-Ukrainian War is a struggle .\\nThe entire Western news media , our own included , have hurled themselves into the fray on the side of “ the brave Ukrainians ” .\\nThere is nothing in the news coverage that encourages us to contrast and compare the events we are witnessing now , with remarkably similar events a great many of us have witnessed in the recent past .\\nThere ’ s nothing that encourages detachment , reflection or the exercise of sober judgement .\\nAs the war unfolds , our news bulletins have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ Five Minute Hate ” from Nineteen Eighty-Four .\\nThe thing to bear in mind as you watch the news coverage is that it is the product of a whole team of journalists and technicians .\\nThey are the people who decide what is shown and how it is edited .\\nThey are the people who write the autocue script for the news anchor/s to read in front of the cameras .\\nWhat you are watching is a carefully constructed narrative which , in its essentials , does not change from broadcast to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast of heroes and villains to cheer on and condemn .\\nAn occasional nod in the direction of fairness and balance may be inserted , but any serious challenge to the narrative will be contradicted more or less immediately .\\nNothing is permitted to blunt the emotional impact of the coverage .\\nThe journalism to which we are nightly subjected is not intended to supply information , it is intended to be affective – that is to say it is aimed almost exclusively at arousing our feelings .\\nPause here and think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At war with Ukraine is a nation in possession of more nuclear devices than any other nation on the planet .\\nWith each passing day the Western news media ’ s portrayal of the President of the Russian Federation , Vladimir Putin , grows increasingly lurid .\\nHe has become a devil-like caricature : someone who is clearly either mad or bad – probably both .\\nThe people responsible for our nightly news bulletins do nothing to dispel this characterisation , indeed , they reinforce it .\\nNo one anywhere appears to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go on demonising Vladimir Putin ?\\nIs it prudent to promote the imposition of an ever-increasing number of crippling sanctions upon Putin , his supporters and his people ?\\nIf he truly is as mad and bad as the Western media is suggesting , might such tactics not cause him to lash out with his nuclear weapons ?\\nTake , for example , the massacre of civilians at Bucha .\\nRight across the West , Putin is being branded a war criminal , and calls are growing for him to be put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Hess at the end of World War II .\\nExcept that nobody knows what happened in Bucha – apart from the fact that many civilians lost their lives .\\nThere has been no independent investigation ; no collection of evidence and eye-witness testimony , no patient piecing together of a timeline .\\nThe forensic work simply hasn ’ t been done .\\nThe world simply does not know if the killings were the result of a deliberate policy , formulated by Russian commanders , at the behest of Putin ; or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrified and panicky conscript soldiers who had seen dozens of their comrades killed and wounded as their armoured column was blown to pieces by the Ukrainian armed forces – fellow Slavs who , they ’ d been assured , were their friends and compatriots .\\nInasmuch as he ordered the invasion of Ukraine , Putin is culpable .\\nWithout his order , the terrible events of the past few weeks would not have happened .\\nIn that sense , the Russian President does indeed have blood on his hands .\\nBut to hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without evidence , without witnesses , without a trial ; isn ’ t that asking for trouble ?\\nWhat incentive is the West giving Putin to negotiate a peace settlement ?\\nWhat is it doing to reduce the chances of the Russian Bear , backed into a corner , from lashing out with his thermos-nuclear claws ?\\nMoreover , as John Minto so rightly points out in his latest post , if Putin is a war criminal , then so are the men who launched the illegal invasion of Iraq in 2003 .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ video , released to the world by Chelsea Manning and Julian Assange , of the crew of an American Apache attack-helicopter opening fire on a group of unarmed Iraqi civilians and journalists in Baghdad , on July 12 , 2007 , surely understands , there are no “ goody ” countries and “ baddy ” countries .\\nThe United States is no less guilty than the Russian Federation of plotting and waging “ aggressive war ” on a fellow member of the United Nations .\\n“ There were no sanctions against the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no US soldiers , military leaders or politicians held to account .\\nThere were no arms sent to help the Iraqis facing overwhelming odds in their fight against the US and its allies .\\nThere were no moves to charge George Bush ( US President ) , Tony Blair ( UK Prime Minister ) or John Howard ( Australian Prime Minister ) for war crimes before the International Criminal Court.\\n” [ In fact , the USA refuses to accept the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court !\\n– C.T . ]\\nAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the course of the day there is scant evidence that anybody on the “ team ” is raising these sorts of objections , or demanding at least some effort be made to place what is happening in Ukraine in its historical context .\\nWhile it is true that many younger journalists would only have been children in 2003 , that is certainly not true of their senior colleagues .\\nAs experienced journalists they should all have vivid memories of the Iraq War and its many crimes .\\nWhat that means is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Russo-Ukrainian War , New Zealand broadcasters and publishers are either unconsciously , or deliberately , suppressing all recollection of the events that have shaped the last thirty years .\\nOne almost hopes they are doing so deliberately : that , at least , would suggest they believe in something – no matter how bereft it might be of historical understanding and/or moral purpose .\\nThe alternative explanation : that the past has simply dropped out of their day-to-day consciousness , and that they receive the Ukraine “ story ” ready-made from “ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interrogate or challenge ; is much , much scarier .\\nIt was the Czech novelist , Milan Kundera , who said it best : “ The struggle of man against power is the struggle of memory against forgetting ”',\n",

       "  'content': 'The emergence of Breitbart News , Donald Trump and the alt-right media ecology inspired a cornucopia of conspiracist websites and streaming services .\\nTheir content flows across social media platforms and percolates into everyday life .\\nFalsehoods concerning COVID-19 and vaccine medicine have contributed to the process .\\nOne standard trope is that the mainstream media ( radio , television , press ) are corrupt , state-controlled and purveyors of “ fake news.\\n” Of course , the real situation is more complex .\\nFake news , along with other forms of disinformation , can be found anywhere , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to professional codes of conduct , official standards of basic accuracy and the legal proscriptions of defamation .\\nMeanwhile , the volume , speed and immediacy of noxious , online traffic overwhelms the slow-moving routines of fact-checking and verification .\\nYet , the growing reliance on social media co-exists with a trust decline in mainstream media .\\nThe 2022 Edelman Trust Barometer report covering 36,000 plus respondents from 28 countries found that 50 percent trusted their media .\\nThe survey fieldwork was conducted in November 2021 .\\nThis represented a significant decline .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed trust in their media https : //www.edelman.com/trust/2020-trust-barometer ) .\\nAmong New Zealanders , the decline in trust has been far greater .\\nIn 2020 , 62 percent of New Zealanders trusted the news they consumed .\\nIn 2022 , the figure dropped markedly to 52 percent .\\nThese findings arise from Trust in News in Aotearoa New Zealand 2022 .\\nThis report , co-authored by Merja Myllylahti and Greg Treadwell , is published by AUT ’ s Journalism Media and Democracy ( JMAD ) Research Centre .\\nReaders of this blog will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major publication , on media ownership in Aotearoa-New Zealand .\\nThis year ’ s Trust in News report , the third of its kind , applies and extends a questionnaire template set out by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism in its international Digital News Report .\\nIn New Zealand , an online survey of 1,085 adults was carried out from February 22 to March 1 this year .\\nAllow me to identify and consider some key findings .\\nFirst up , engagement was high .\\nSeventy four percent of respondents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news .\\nIn terms of news sources , TVNZ and Stuff were mentioned by 64 percent of those sampled .\\nNewshub/TV3 was mentioned by 49 percent , NZ Herald online by 48 percent and Radio New Zealand ( RNZ ) by 32 percent .\\nApproximately 43 percent of respondents named social media as a news source .\\nThese figures suggest that established media institutions and social media platforms compete for the attention of news consumers .\\nFor many New Zealanders , social media news is an important component of their overall news diet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news media is especially distrusted .\\nOf the 182 people who supplied comments to the survey , approximately 26 percent said that they didn ’ t trust the media because it was funded by government .\\nFrom the verbatim comments recounted in the report , one point is clear—hardly anyone understands the difference between state-led media and public media .\\nRather , it is claimed that the government “ buys ” journalists with grants and funds , that mainstream media are “ just a propaganda wing of government ” and that “ New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of government.\\n” Specifically , most well-known news brands saw significant declines in trust from 2021 to 2022 and from 2020 to 2022 .\\nThey include RNZ , TVNZ , Newshub , Newsroom , the NZ Herald and Stuff .\\nThese figures should be put alongside the answers given to another set of questions .\\nInterviewers asked respondents whether they were concerned about the blurring of real news and fake news on the internet .\\nSixty five percent of respondents expressed such concerns , compared with 68 percent in 2021 .\\nThis drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coincides with an increase in extremist conspiracist content across New Zealand social media platforms .\\nAgainst this backdrop , the report found , also , that approximately 14 percent of 2022 respondents were not concerned at all about the quality of content on the internet .\\nThere was far more concern about the reliability of mainstream news media .\\nIn this context , respondents were asked about poor journalism ( e.g.\\n, stories with spin or twisted facts to push a particular agenda , stories made up for political or commercial reasons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .\\nApproximately 36 percent of the sample were extremely concerned about such trends , compared with 30 percent in 2021 .\\nThe point here is not that the mainstream media is being criticised unfairly .\\nRather , it ’ s that the level and vehemence of the criticism is disproportionate .\\nRespondent criticism of social media sites was comparatively less even though online misinformation and disinformation had been increasing .\\nThe findings of this report complement those of the Disinformation Project from Te Punaha Matatini at the University of Auckland .\\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kate Hannah , Sanjana Hattotuwa and Kayli Taylor analysed the spread of mis- and disinformation across social media from 17 August to 5 November 2021 .\\nOver this period , the COVID-19 Delta variant arrived , the government introduced a Level 4 lockdown and vigorously instituted a nationwide vaccination campaign .\\nThe researchers found “ a sharp increase in the popularity and intensity of COVID-19-specific disinformation and other forms of “ dangerous speech ” and disinformation related to far-right ideologies ” .\\nMore particularly , they found increases in “ volume ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platforms and apps [ that ] content is produced and shared on ) and velocity ( speed at which content is produced ) .\\n” These trends predate the nationwide spread of anti-mandate protests and the three-week occupation of parliament grounds over February and March .\\nDuring that time , social media disinformation reached a new intensity .\\nThe streaming site Counterspin , for example , provided 24/7 coverage and directives for the protesters .\\nSo , on the basis of JMAD ’ s Trust in News report and Te Punaha Matatini ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I make the following observations .\\nThese should inform further research .\\n• None Continuing corrosion of trust in the news media will further discredit and devalue the principles of journalism .\\n• None Lack of trust in news media combined with social media disinformation will fuel extremist political sentiments with uncertain electoral consequences .\\n• None Declining trust in the news media coincides with declining trust in government per se .\\nA growing disillusionment with the political system and public institutions is the likely outcome .\\n• None The preceding tendencies are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as disparate groups talk past each other .',\n",

       "  'content': 'THE GREAT GEOPOLITICAL CHALLENGE confronting the United States is that the Americas are separated from Eurasia by two broad oceans .\\nSince the end of the Second World War , from which it emerged as the undisputed global hegemon , this geopolitical challenge has required the American government to transform Western Europe into a military , economic and cultural appendage of the United States .\\nHad the United States failed to effect this transformation , its own economy would have faltered , and capitalism , as a global system , could very easily have collapsed .\\nMaking the nations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American economy – principally as borrowers of American dollars and consumers of American exports – was crucial to preserving the American people ’ s economic prosperity and , hence , the USA ’ s political stability .\\nHad the USA not launched the “ Marshall Plan ” for European recovery , and intervened aggressively in the domestic politics of France and Italy , it is practically certain that the formidable Communist Parties of those two countries would have come to power , bringing the whole of Europe under the tutelage of the Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a majority shareholding in Great Britain Ltd during the darkest days of 1940 .\\nIt return for the US President , Franklin D. Roosevelt , keeping his country in the war , Winston Churchill , was forced to set in motion the dissolution of the British Empire .\\nIt is likely Churchill pardoned himself for this capitulation to necessity with fairy tales about a “ special relationship ” between the USA and Great Britain .\\nNo doubt he truly believed that in the unfolding history of the English-speaking peoples , Britain would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ancient Greece to America ’ s Ancient Rome : peacefully blending its old empire into something new and altogether larger and more powerful .\\nThe Americans would not have disagreed with the last bit , but they were never foolish enough to believe in the rest .\\nSince becoming the world ’ s banker during the First World War , US capitalism had been aching to get its hands on the protected markets and resources of the geographically vast British Empire .\\nThe only thing the Americans were willing to share with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Brits found out to their cost during the Suez Crisis of 1956 , the sun had well and truly set on the British Empire .\\nIt had become an expensive joke .\\nThe British lion was stuffed .\\nWhich still left the USA facing the problem of Eurasia .\\nThe Soviet Union and China might be broken and destitute after years of oppression and war , but beneath the graves and the rubble lay resources that could make them rich enough to one day compete with the United States for the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The geopolitical planners in Washington understood that American hegemony could only be sustained by making damn sure that neither Russia nor China ever arrived at that strategically critical position .\\nWhat they were in the process of doing to the British Empire , they were determined , eventually , to do to the Russians and the Chinese : break them into pieces and transfer their markets and resources into the safekeeping of Uncle Sam .\\nBy 1991 it looked as though America ’ s geopoliticians had done it .\\nThe Soviet Union had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the taking , and the People ’ s Republic of China had allowed itself to be transformed into a giant American factory .\\nNo wonder a US State Department analyst , Francis Fukuyama , had jubilantly penned a paper entitled “ The End of History ” .\\nBut , the clever boys and girls in the State Department , and their moronic friends in the military and the CIA , had not factored in the extraordinary historical resilience of the Russians and the Chinese .\\nHenry Ford had told his fellow Americans that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had believed him .\\nDrunk on the heady brew of their new “ unipolar world ” , US geopoliticians had called their global victory too soon .\\nEventually , after twenty years of getting its ass kicked in the Middle East , the United States had to confront the inconvenient truth that Eurasia wasn ’ t beaten yet – not by a long shot .\\nInevitably , Russia and China had brought forth leaders in possession of the requisite political steel to exploit the Americans ’ mistaken assumption that they could command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ – and it would dance .\\nOnly when it was too late did Washington understand that Moscow and Beijing has music of their own , and dance-steps with which America was entirely unfamiliar .\\nIn the global edition of Dancing With The Stars , Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping made Bush , Obama , Trump and Biden look like flat-footed rubes .\\nSnapping out of their premature imperial bender , the Americans did their best to re-energise the Drang nach Osten ( Drive to the East ) that had been set in motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nThe United States ’ geopolitical catspaw , Nato , had been expanded all the way to the borders of the Russian Federation .\\nWashington and its surrogates were stirring up trouble in China ’ s western border province of Xinjiang .\\nBait the Bear and Poke the Dragon had become the only games in town .\\nBut these were no sand-blasted Middle-eastern dictators they were facing .\\nRussia and China were nuclear powers .\\nGetting rid of Putin and Xi would require something the Americans have never been over-endowed with – guile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Putin , baited it with Ukraine , and waited .\\nIf Russia took the bait , the United States and Nato would unleash , as one pundit put it : “ an economic and cultural Barbarossa ” .\\nAnd if Xi was foolish enough to come to Putin ’ s aid , then they were quite willing to declare full-scale economic war on the People ’ s Republic as well .\\nA geopolitical twofer !\\nExcept , the imposition of crippling sanctions cuts both ways .\\nThe USA is pinning all its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia and China succumbing to the impact of the West ’ s economic warfare before it blows back into Europe , Africa , the Middle East , South Asia and , ultimately , and perhaps a lot faster than Washington anticipates , into America itself .\\nThe Russian Federation has released a map of the world showing all those nations who have declared themselves “ Enemies of Russia ” by joining the economic blockade .\\nThe most striking thing about the map is that it identifies not only Putin ’ s ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also those parts of the world inhabited by white people .\\nIf Eurasia survives the sanctions ; and if , in the process , it creates a new economic order from which the great American hegemon and its hangers-on are excluded ; then it will not be the USA that wins the Great Game , it will be Russia and China , the masters of Eurasia .\\nBecause , as the inventor of geopolitics , Sir Halford Mackinder ( 1861-1947 ) wrote more than a century ago : “ Who rules East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] Who rules the Heartland commands the World Island ; [ Eurasia plus Africa ] Who rules the World Island commands the World .\\n”',\n",

       "  'content': 'While the war crimes being committed in Ukraine mount , the Western news media and government leaders unite in innocence , as if the US invasion of Iraq and other Western violations of human rights had never happened .\\nA US offer for Ukraine to join NATO is revealed in US internal documents , released by WikiLeaks as well as a former US Ambassador to Russia , Jack Matlock ( a Russia specialist in the US Diplomatic Corps ) who wrote recently before the invasion : “ Since Putin ’ s major demand is an assurance that NATO will take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ukraine or Georgia , obviously there would have been no basis for the present crisis if there had been no expansion of the alliance following the end of the Cold War , or if the expansion had occurred in harmony with building a security structure in Europe that included Russia.\\n” Noam Chomsky , in an interview with Jewish Voice for Labour , made a crucial observation : “ There is good reason to believe that this tragedy could have been avoided , until the last minute .\\nWe ’ ve discussed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Putin launched the criminal aggression right now , we can speculate as we like .\\nBut the immediate background is not obscure — evaded but not contested .\\nIt ’ s easy to understand why those suffering from the crime may regard it as an unacceptable indulgence to inquire into why it happened and whether it could have been avoided .\\nUnderstandable , but mistaken .\\nIf we want to respond to the tragedy in ways that will help the victims , and avert still worse catastrophes that loom ahead , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as we can about what went wrong and how the course could have been corrected .\\nHeroic gestures may be satisfying .\\nThey are not helpful.\\n” Chomsky also widened the issue , in order to wake us up : “ .\\n.\\n.\\nwe should also try to find ways to help a much broader class of victims : all life on Earth .\\nThis catastrophe took place at a moment where all of the great powers , indeed all of us , must be working together to control the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already exacting a grim toll , with much worse soon to come unless major efforts are undertaken quickly .\\nTo drive home the obvious , the IPCC just released the latest and by far most ominous of its regular assessments of how we are careening to catastrophe .\\nMeanwhile , the necessary actions are stalled , even driven into reverse , as badly needed resources are devoted to destruction and the world is now on a course to expand the use of fossil fuels , including the most dangerous and conveniently abundant of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conjuncture could hardly be devised by a malevolent demon .\\nIt can ’ t be ignored .\\nEvery moment counts.\\n” Yet , in a speech made last December , Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky hailed the State of Israel as “ an example ” for Ukraine and this year , on 5 April , declared on the President ’ s official website that Ukraine “ will definitely become a ‘ big Israel ‘ with its own face.\\n” He continued : “ We will not be surprised that we will have representatives of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all institutions , supermarkets , cinemas , there will be people with weapons.\\n” With worldwide attention now firmly focused on the human misery being imposed by Russia ’ s invasion of Ukraine , Israel ’ s daily human rights violations are likely to fade even more from public view – no doubt with much relief within pro-Zionist circles .\\nThat being the case , the defence of Palestinian human rights must continue to be even more vigorously supported .\\nIn what a UK BBC article described as a “ call to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported that the Ukraine National Security and Defence Council has urged its citizens to engage in “ cocktail resistance ” and use petrol-bombs against Russian invaders .\\nIt takes courage , for one person , to face a highly-militarised foreign invader with something so small and personal as a petrol-bomb .\\nThe Western news media report strongly on the determined resistance demonstrated by individual Ukrainians , yet either ignore or , alternatively , denigrate similar acts of resistance taken by some Palestinians against another invader , the Western-aligned and -financed Zionist regime , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military defence force has successfully managed to slow down the Russian advance but the militarily-Occupied Palestinians remain defenceless .\\nIsrael is subjugating a people whose land it has been gradually annexing for decades .\\nLast month , a young Palestinian man , Ahmed Seif , shot by Israeli forces , died from his wounds .\\nHe had been shot in the stomach three times during a protest demonstration in the village of Burqa .\\nThe Israeli Army said it had “ responded with live fire ” because the “ rioter ” had “ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” .\\nAlso last month , a 16-year-old youth , Yamen Jafal , was shot dead by the Israeli Army , near Abu Dis , again after throwing petrol-bombs .\\nThe Western news media never report such killings by Israel .\\nNearly 2.9 million Palestinians are forced to give way to around 475,000 Jewish settlers Occupying the West Bank in settlements considered illegal under international law .\\nThe forces that impose the settlers frequently invade Palestinian homes , by night and by day , and both the settlers and the military raid Palestinian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of agricultural sabotage .\\nSettlers move freely across the Occupied West Bank , while Palestinians are forced to wait at Israeli military checkpoints for ‘ permission ‘ to travel – no wonder the people protest !\\nIsrael ’ s intentionally heartless blockade of Gaza is even more constraining .\\nWhile Israeli forces enter and leave Gaza whenever they wish , its isolation of Gaza , by land , air and sea amounts to collective punishment and a gross violation of international law .\\nSevere restriction of imports and exports , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , means the Gaza economy , infrastructure and vital services are collapsing .\\nThe stark reality of this oppression for everyone can be summed up in the recent experience of just one family : On 25 March this year , a 19-month-old child , Fatma Jalal al-Masri , died at the European Hospital in Gaza , as a result of Israel denying her access to the Al-Makassed Hospital in Jerusalem , despite her having obtained a medical referral and three hospital appointments there .\\nThe Israeli human rights movement , B ’ Tselem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemptuous and callous military training exercises in the North Jordan Valley .\\nThree Palestinian villages as well as eleven other Palestinian communities in the area are subjected to troops and tank deployment , mortar shelling and the use of live ammunition .\\nPeople are being driven from their homes while farmland and pasture are being ruined .\\nThe Israeli Army blocks access to roads whenever it pleases .\\nIsraeli military exercises carelessly leave unexploded ordnance behind them , causing occasional injury and sometimes even death .\\nB ’ Tselem explains that the military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s longstanding policy aimed at driving Palestinian communities out of the area .\\nInstead of openly loading residents onto trucks and removing them , Israel is going to great lengths to create impossible living conditions that will , eventually , push them to leave the area , seemingly of their own accord.\\n” In line with this policy , Israel also demolishes homes and agricultural facilities while encouraging settler violence and denying Palestinians access to basic services , such as electricity and running water .\\nOn the first of this month , Israeli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubber-coated bullets , stun grenades and tear gas canisters , invaded Jenin as well as a number of homes in the Jenin UN refugee camp , killing a 17-year old refugee , Sanad Mohammed Khalil Abu Atiyah , and a Jenin resident , Yazid Nidal Saad Al-Din Al-Saadi .\\nFifteen people were wounded in the raids .\\nThe same day , in Jenin , near the entrance to Araba , the Israeli Army ambushed and opened fire on a vehicle carrying three people , whom the Israeli Occupation described as “ wanted ” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governments refuse to countenance calls to restrain Israel , and the Zionist regime continues to belong in media bodies such as Eurovision and EU research projects like Horizon 2020 .\\nIsrael also enjoys lucrative arms deals and huge financial support .\\nThe US is Israel ’ s most generous supporter and European countries also support its military .\\nBesides all that , the Israeli regime continues to enjoy full diplomatic and trade relations with most countries .\\nThe international community ‘ s selective reaction to violations of international law and human rights betrays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nNew Zealand ’ s Foreign Affairs Minister , Nanaia Mahuta , calls for “ Russia to be held to account for the war crimes and atrocities committed against innocent civilians.\\n” Why then does she never call for Israel to be called to account ?',\n",

of these for any party promoting radical policies is that they must attract more than 5 percent of the Party Votes cast ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a seat or seats in the House of Representatives .\\nCrossing that 5 percent threshold in 2020 meant attracting somewhere in the vicinity of 145,000 votes .\\nWith 226,757 votes ( 7.8 percent ) the Greens easily made it into Parliament .\\nThe question to be answered , then , is a simple one .\\nIf the mooted constitutional changes proceed , how many formerly Green voters is the party likely to lose ?\\nIf the answer is greater than 81,000 , and Chloe Swarbrick fails to hold Auckland Central , then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented in Parliament .\\nEighty-one thousand votes may sound like a lot , but consider the fate of the Alliance – a coalition of radical parties of which the Greens were once part .\\nBetween the 1999 and 2002 general elections , 133,971 of the Alliance ’ s party voters took their support elsewhere .\\nIts share of the Party Vote fell from 7.7 percent to 1.3 percent , and it ceased to be a parliamentary party .\\nSuch is the fate of political parties which , for one reason or another , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their supporters .\\nThe transition from hero to zero can be brutally quick .\\nAll too often the risk of alienating a critical number of party supporters is seriously underestimated by party members .\\nThe latter are dangerously prone to believing that their electoral support base is , in all practical respects , indistinguishable from themselves .\\nThis is , however , almost never the case – especially for those parties capable of cresting the 5 percent threshold .\\nSupport is won on the strength of a great many considerations – and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on just a single issue .\\nVoters are not required to be either rational or consistent , and an alarming number of them are neither .\\nParty members are almost always more ideologically consistent than party supporters .\\nAll of these factors are acutely relevant to the Green Party .\\nA large chunk of its support ( perhaps most of it ) is based upon the perceived urgency of state action to combat Climate Change .\\nOther voters ’ will back the Greens for the party ’ s original commitment to social justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility ” ) .\\nSome will back the Greens ’ on account of their pacifism and because the party is committed to an ethical foreign policy .\\nMany more will vote Green simply because they are in favour of decriminalising cannabis .\\nThe number attracted to the Greens because they have altered their constitution to reflect their opposition to binary , heteronormative gender relations is likely to be considerably smaller than any of the groups of voters mentioned above .\\nOutside of a very small fraction of the highly-educated professional middle-class , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studying at university , such matters display something pretty close to zero political salience .\\nCertain to display much greater salience with progressive voters will be the obvious disdain evinced by a large number of Green Party members for the political performance of their male co-leader , James Shaw , along with the equally obvious determination of those same disdainful members to remove him from his position .\\nWhile a great many Green voters are dissatisfied with the current government ’ s performance on Climate Change , this does not necessarily mean that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handling of the Climate Change portfolio .\\nMost will realise that Shaw exercises very little influence over the behaviour of the Jacinda Ardern-led Labour Government , and more than a few will applaud Shaw for having parlayed the very weak hand he was dealt to such good effect and with such political skill .\\nThe idea that he is being eased out of his male co-leader ’ s role by means of a transparent piece of constitutional manipulation may not sit well with these voters .\\nBy them the manoeuvre may be judged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel unable to go on supporting a party that is prepared to countenance such shabby procedural trickery .\\nOther Green supporters will attempt to match up the proposed constitutional changes with the four core tenets of the global Green movement : Ecological Wisdom , Social Justice , Grassroots Democracy , and Non-Violence .\\nThey will struggle to see very much in the way of wisdom , justice , or democracy in any of these proposals .\\nBut , they will not miss the venomous emotional violence inherent in the execution of a political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some politicians while ruthlessly sacrificing those of others .\\nThese supporters , too , may feel unable to go on rewarding a party capable of such passive aggressive behaviour with their votes .\\nFinally , there is the crucial question of political perception .\\nWhat do these mooted constitutional changes make the Green Party look like ?\\nDo they make the Greens look like a political organisation welcoming to all New Zealanders ?\\nDo they make the Greens look like a group of politicians capable of setting priorities conducive to producing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Zealand and the planet so urgently require ?\\nDo they make the Greens look the way they used to look , back in the days of Rod Donald , Jeanette Fitzsimons , Sue Bradford , Keith Locke , Sue Kedgley and Nandor Tanczos : a group of people who like and support one another in the promotion of causes no rational voter can fail to acknowledge ?\\nOr , do they make the Greens look like a political party that would rather be politically correct than politically successful ?\\nA party on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 81,000 votes .',\n",

       "  'content': 'IN THE END , the question comes down to this : can human-beings be trusted to do the right thing ?\\nIf you think that they can , then you will be a democrat and , probably , a socialist .\\nIf people can be trusted , what possible reason could you possibly have for not trusting them ?\\nAll of them .\\nAll of the time .\\nWith everything .\\nThe problem with trusting all of the people , all of the time : that is to say , with democratic socialism ; is that most of us don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people .\\nNot all of the time .\\nMost of us work on the principle that there are some people who can not , who should not , be trusted .\\nSome people are simply too stupid to be trusted .\\nOthers are too venal – too greedy .\\nStill more are dishonest and manipulative .\\nAnd , finally , a certain irreducible percentage of any given population are just too damn evil to be trusted – with anything .\\nBut , once you admit that only some of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then your journey away from democracy and socialism has already begun .\\nThe moment our common humanity ceases to be sufficient reason for determining society ’ s course , then it becomes necessary to establish some other criterion for participating in the decision-making process .\\nImmediately , this presents us with a new problem .\\nWho gets to set the criteria for participation ?\\nShould it be the wisest ?\\nThe richest ?\\nThe strongest ?\\nThe most cunning ?\\nIt ’ s a question that has perplexed the thinkers of every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nHistory ’ s answer is unequivocal : decision-making in practically every society there has ever been settles eventually upon the shoulders of the richest and the strongest .\\n( Although the most cunning usually contrive to also have a say in the running of things ! )\\nWhat about Ancient Athens ?\\nThe world ’ s first democracy ?\\nWell , for a start , Ancient Athens was a far cry from a system of government that trusted all the people , all the time .\\nIf you were a woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision-making was expressly forbidden .\\nThe same applied to “ foreigners ” , no matter how long they had lived in the city .\\nOnly free Athenian males could vote or hold office .\\nWhat ’ s more , Athenian democracy was mostly a reaction to bad government , not an experiment in good government .\\nThe free men of the army and navy that preserved the independence of the city-state , reacting against the misrule of tyrants ( strong men ) and oligarchs ( rich men ) came up with the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city to themselves .\\nWhat the freemen of Athens never overcame , however , were the political effects of the unequal distribution of talent and guile .\\nSome men were good talkers .\\nOthers were superb schemers .\\nDemocracies throughout history have proved to be extremely vulnerable to such individuals .\\nThe other great paradox of democracy is that it tends to be undermined by its own success .\\nAthens became extremely wealthy and could not resist the temptation to use its riches to overpower its weaker and poorer neighbours .\\nUnfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasingly fragile .\\nThose made wealthy by imperialism – always a minority – all-too-often use their ill-gotten riches to corrupt the democratic process .\\nThe resulting progression toward oligarchy and plutocracy can only then be stopped by the intervention of a demagogue who , if successful , soon assumes the role of tyrant .\\nRich men , or strong men .\\nIt is not an appealing choice .\\nBut , surely , these ancient precedents do not apply to us ?\\nIn the Twenty-First Century just about every member-state of the United Nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sort , has become the norm .\\nAll of the people : regardless of their race , colour , sex or creed ; get to decide .\\nMaybe not all the time , but certainly every few years – at the ballot box .\\nSo , aren ’ t we all democrats now ?\\nDemocrats , maybe .\\nBut certainly not socialists .\\nThe most important thing to note about the governing arrangements of the last 200 years is the way in which political power has been separated from economic power .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ people have been given a say over less and less .\\nThe truth of this observation becomes obvious the moment the ordinary citizen gives a moment ’ s thought to how much power they get to wield every day in the place they spend most of their waking hours – the workplace .\\nThe contemporary capitalist enterprise ( think Amazon ) is not in the least bit democratic .\\nSubtract the hours spent travelling to and from the workplace , and the hours spent sleeping , and most of the lives of most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where tyranny is the norm .\\nNothing is more fiercely resisted in the capitalist enterprise than workers attempting to democratise the employment relationship .\\n( Once again , think Amazon . )\\nThe greatest political struggles of the past 200 years have been sparked by the attempts of working men and women to wrest some measure of control over their economic circumstances from the capitalists whose enterprises have come to dominate more and more of their lives .\\nSocial-democracy can not be countenanced by capitalism , precisely because it seeks to merge politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single movement .\\nIn order to fight social-democracy effectively , capitalist intellectuals have arrived at the startling conclusion that no human-beings can be trusted to do the right thing .\\nThat people are , indeed , too stupid , too venal , too greedy , too dishonest , too manipulative , and , ultimately , too damned evil , to be entrusted with decision-making power over .\\nThe truly innovative aspect of this radically anti-democratic and anti-socialist doctrine is that the capitalists have included themselves among the human-beings who can ’ t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are convinced that a mechanism exists which can be relied upon to produce optimal outcomes in every conceivable set of circumstances .\\nInto this mechanism are fed the billions of choices made by human-beings everyday over every aspect of their lives .\\nFrom the cut and style of a suit , to the creaminess of an ice-cream , to the speed and efficiency of a motor vehicle : the market mechanism is wiser than any individual , more efficient than any government , and confers upon each participant in its processes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the lives of others .\\nAccording to this doctrine , the dollar bills spent by ordinary citizens are a more effective determinant of the public good than any number of triennial ballot papers .\\nThe only politics which these radical capitalists ( whom some call Neoliberals ) are prepared to tolerate , is the politics dedicated to protecting and extending the market mechanism .\\nTheirs is a politics devoted to identifying the designs of the social-democrats , and devising the most effective means of defeating them .\\nIt is a politics dedicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level of faith in the market mechanism that is practically religious .\\nA politics which paints every attempt to force the market to generate specified outcomes as the work of totalitarian socialists .\\nArrogant politicians and bureaucrats , whose necessarily limited information can not produce anything other than economic catastrophe and the extinction of personal liberty .\\nTheir so far winning wager has been that those who decline to trust their fellow human-beings to do the right thing will , in very short order , cease to trust themselves .',\n",

oppose the US/UK plans .\\nOver a million protesters flooded the streets of the UK ’ s largest cities in what was , almost certainly , the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history .\\nVast crowds similarly thronged the streets of American cities .\\nIn France , Italy and Germany it was the same .\\nTime Magazine described the global peace movement as the other great power on the planet .\\nAll to no avail .\\nLike the Russian Federation , the United States was not about to be dissuaded from doing what it believed it had to do .\\nThat it would go to war without the sanction of the UN Security Council , and on the basis of intelligence claims that most independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to slow the administration of George W Bush down .\\nPeace movement or no peace movement , the invasion would go ahead as planned .\\nThe demonstrable futility of the international protest movement against the Iraq War offers a pretty solid explanation for the absence of a global pacifist response to the Russo-Ukrainian War .\\nAmong those coming of age in the first quarter of the Twenty-First Century it may simply be understood that if a major power is resolved to attack another country , no amount of chanting and placard-waving will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UK Prime Minister Tony Blair ’ s spin-doctors respond to media taunts that there were a million citizens on out on the streets , by referencing the tens-of-millions who weren ’ t ?\\nThe other obvious lesson to be drawn from the global protests against the US/UK invasion of Iraq is that they would never have happened ( or , at least , not on anything like the same scale ) had their organisers not been living in democracies .\\nIf the Russian Federation showed the same respect for fundamental human rights as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a million or more Russians would have turned out to protest the invasion of Ukraine .\\nWhat the world actually witnessed , however , on the streets of Moscow and St Petersburg , was the brutal suppression of every attempt at protest by the thuggish Russian police .\\nIt is these images of suppression and violence that bring us to the heart of the matter .\\nPeople around the world rose up against the prospect of the invasion of Iraq in part because they believed that the two nations responsible , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in some hallowed and undefiled place , receptive to the moral case for peace .\\nAll the evidence may have pointed in the opposite direction , but , in their heart-of-hearts , the historical friends and allies of the United States and the United Kingdom wanted to – needed to – believe that they were better than the murderous bullies Bush and Blair had turned them into .\\nVery few people believe that some hallowed and undefiled place exists in the dark monstrosity that is the Russian state .\\nThere are no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of freedom and justice do not grow there .\\nThe conditions are too harsh .\\nEven when the tree of liberty is smuggled in and persuaded to bloom , which is seldom , the flowers fade for lack of warmth .\\nRussia is a hard , cold country , and difficult to love , even if you ’ ve a mind to .\\nBut no people on earth knows more about suffering – and how to share it .\\nAnd we are suffering , but not in a way that does Russia any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspired by the pain and heroism of the Ukrainian people .\\nHow else are the people of the West supposed to feel when they are presented with the image of a Ukrainian father , now a soldier , fighting back tears as his wife and son are borne away from him on a westbound train to safety , clutching in his hands his little boy ’ s toy ambulance – all that is left to him ?\\nAre we supposed to be filled with an urge to make peace ?\\nOr , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bodies in the street , the terrible revelations of rape and torture : these only make matters worse .\\nOur instinctive response , when confronted with such images is not to calmly contemplate the best means of extricating all concerned from the horrors of war , but to punish those responsible for such atrocities .\\nPerhaps that ’ s what they ’ re intended to do .\\nPerhaps , as the Russians insist , they are fake news .\\nBut while such images are all the world is seeing , there will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there is worse to come : if the wounded Russian Bear tears the Ukraine to pieces ; and the world is bombarded with ever more tragic and terrifying images of Ukraine in extremis ; it will not be a global peace movement that emerges , but a war movement .\\nRepeating the mass demonstrations of ecstatic citizens celebrating the outbreak of the First World War , the people of the West , heedless of the nuclear danger , will cry : “ Do your worst , Russia – and we will do @ @ @',\n",

       "  'content': 'It has been said that a frequent problem of Wars Happening To Other People is that one learns decidedly the wrong lessons to be drawn from them .\\nThis applies both to militaries – but also to other external observers .\\nParticularly where there are ‘ propagandtastic ’ reasons for doing so .\\nThe present conflict in Ukraine is already producing quite the escalating pile-up of these .\\nYesterday ’ s strike on the Russian flagship of the Black Sea Fleet – the Moskva – is going to be another one .\\nThere ’ s been a lot of corresponding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to say it ’ s all Americans , but it has significantly seemed to be Americans ) about this .\\nThat ’ s understandable .\\nEverybody likes backing the underdog .\\nBut the way some of it has been phrased , is as if this event indicates that there ’ s a laughably bad trait to Russian military hardware .\\nAnd that a “ real ” warship , a “ proper ” warship , an “ American ” warship , would be untouchable by comparison .\\nLiterally , the thing that sparked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing basically the above and attaching a picture of a current US aircraft carrier and declaring that if the Moskva was what the Russians thought a large warship was – well , this was what a REAL large warship looked like .\\nPersonally , I saw something rather different – a large target .\\nAnd that ’ s just the thing .\\nThe reason the People ’ s Republic of China is currently festooning various atolls and islands throughout the South China Sea with missile-batteries is because they see the same thing .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ asset that has to get ‘ lucky ’ quite a few times in fending off a missile bombardment – whereas the side carrying out said bombardment only has to get lucky a very few times to do significant damage ( or , contingent upon payload , potentially even sink the beast – certainly , necessitate a withdrawal back to port for quite some time ) .\\nNow , I am not going to suggest – as some have – that surface combatants are obsolete in modern naval operations .\\nQuite the contrary .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a role for ships that only wind up underwater involuntarily in contemporary fleets – it just comes down rather heavily to what kind of environment they ’ re operating in , and to what particular purpose they ’ re being deployed .\\nHowever that is an entire series of conversations for another time .\\nWhat I AM going to state – is that the problem encountered by the Russians with the Moskva is not something that necessarily indicates that Russian military hardware is somehow intrinsically bad .\\nAlthough at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year old cruiser in a modern war is going to encounter difficulties .\\nAnd that any warship being hit in the magazine is in for a rough time – especially in rough seas amidst a storm .\\nThe perilous situation of warships against guided missiles is not a novel one , either .\\nDuring the Falklands War , the HMS Sheffield was hit by an Argentine-deployed Exocet missile – and while she did not sink as the immediate result of this impact ( which may not have even featured the missile detonating ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a complete crew evacuation , and lead to her having to be towed by another craft .\\nIt was this last action that actually coincided with the sinking ( although it can be fairly argued that it was somewhat inevitable given the conditions and the rather prominent hole to her side from the missile impact ) .\\nThis latter detail concords with the situation of the Moskva per Russian reports upon the matter – that it did indeed sink , but while being towed and in heavy seas .\\nAs a point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Challenge ’ exercise carried out in 2002 , which simulated an American invasion of a suspiciously similar to Iraq state , a US carrier battle group – nineteen ships – was virtually annihilated inside a few minutes by a single bombardment ( which , to be sure , was comprised of not only missiles – but also an array of other attack-vectors , too ) .\\nNow , to be fair and sure – there are a few … ‘ issues ’ ( to put it politely ) with the degree of extrapolative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events twenty years later elsewhere on the tides of war .\\nLeaving aside the claims about “ cheating ” that got made toward the US general who ’ d been running the not-Iraqi side , or the commentary around ‘ design flaws ’ in the simulation that made some things more viable than they might otherwise have proven in practice – the fact is that in theory there ’ s two decades of additional development of naval active protection countermeasures that should make such a scenario less immediately applicable to today or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how MUCH less applicable is a somewhat open question .\\nAnd I would suspect rather thoroughly that few are eager to genuinely test it out in practice .\\nParticularly as I also have little doubt that the weaponry and other such measures that would be deployed by the OPFOR in such a scenario would also have undergone some further development over the similar time-period .\\nSomething that ’ s not just a matter for future potentially near-parity conflicts , like the People ’ s Republic of China – but also a potent consideration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republic of Iran today .\\nThe point is – it ’ s very easy to laugh at the Russians potentially losing a warship and imagine that the Americans ( or some other Designated Protagonist faction ) would do inestimably better in a similar circumstance .\\nIgnoring that if the Russian hardware in question is ‘ inferior ’ , it may perhaps be because it ’ s a Soviet-era ship designed and built in the 1970s and ‘ modernised ’ in an era of severely ‘ lean times ’ for the Russian military after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 90s .\\nAnd ignoring that even the best warships of the largest and most powerful navy of the modern world are similarly vulnerable to similar threats – and themselves quite actively concerned about exactly this prospect .\\nWe could also speculate about the situation observed during Millennium Challenge pertaining to the actual simulated American invasion itself , in relation to the difficulties encountered by the Russians in their own real-life invasion of Ukraine .\\nI won ’ t go into the details , but suffice to say that in order to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what was supposed to be a weaker opponent ( simulating Iraq , after all ) – as the Joint Forces Command report itself observes : “ the OPFOR free-play was eventually constrained to the point where the end state was scripted.\\n” I shall say that again : in order to carry out an invasion that didn ’ t wind up producing a frankly embarrassing quotient of casualties and frustratingly slow progress , the Americans had to ‘ cheat ’ wildly and basically guarantee themselves a win .\\nAnd that ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would seem , very well lead ) opposition .\\nNow apply that observation to the Ukrainian invasion , with a functionally close-parity opposition that ’ s being actively resupplied by NATO .\\nAll of a sudden , the Russian performance starts to look , perhaps , a bit less ‘ hillaribad ’ via comparison to how an American or other NATO force might do in a similar situation .\\nBut let us move back to hardware .\\nOne area where there has been quite a lot of internet guffawing in recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armour .\\nThe reasons for this are obvious .\\nSocial media has been saturated at various points with images of Russian tanks blown up , abandoned , being towed away by tractors , bogged down in mud , and so on and so forth .\\nWe want to believe , in essence , that the only way they work is the same way various of the Germans insistently told us they work some eighty years ago – by swarming low-quality men and low-quality machines until the proverbial pack of hyenas has somehow managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lions .\\nExcept that ’ s not really the case .\\nThe ( frequently encountered ) German post-WWII historiography was , as others have pointed out , a rather … self-serving situation .\\nPart-explaining away their own shortcomings with an insistent bias ( hence why the Soviets are simultaneously both overwhelming and somehow ‘ inferior ’ ) ; part-telling their English-language ( and particularly American defence establishment ) audiences what they wanted to hear in relation to the then-current Soviet threat .\\nAgain , we won ’ t go into all of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sober analysis tended to show that the Red Army on the offensive wasn ’ t just doing well because it had an awful lot of men and machines … but also because these were men and machines of a rather better quality than their opponents would easily care to admit .\\nAnd also capable of engaging in complex efforts of strategy and strategic deception that likewise weren ’ t commensurate with the stereotypes their opponents insistently affixed to them .\\nBut more upon all of this some other time .\\nThe point is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of pop-pseudo-militaria analysis and run with it .\\nAnd the idea is that because something is ‘ Russian ’ ( or ex-Soviet ) , it therefore axiomatically HAS to be of inferior quality and a laughingstock .\\nIn some cases , there may be some level of truth to this – but not in the manner one might initially think .\\nSoviet armour was designed in a very different way to various of its Western counterparts .\\nThe operational doctrine it was built to adhere to had different requirements .\\nIt really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oranges ’ situations to a certain extent .\\nHowever , it ’ s also the case that when people start insistently comparing Russian armour losses in Ukraine to modern American military hardware to try and make out the former to be intrinsically terrible … they ’ re similarly being rather wildly unfair .\\nBecause this often means discussing a tank built in the 1980s and with questionable modernization efforts in the intervening decades since – as compared to the latest , top-of-the-line ultra-modern hardware from , again , the most powerful nation upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicle is going to come out on top .\\nWhy does this matter ?\\nBecause the truth is , once again , not that the experience in Ukraine around these demonstrates a ‘ Russian ’ problem – but rather , that it points toward a general problem One that also afflicts other nations , and which can not be easily handwaved away by declaring “ oh , those are Russian tanks so they ’ re inferior – it won ’ t happen to us ” ( whomever the ‘ us ’ or ‘ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so happen to be ) .\\nI shall quote something brief I ’ d written about exactly this a few days ago : “ One significant issue is that the ‘ balance ’ between armour/maneuver ( offence ) and ranged-killing power ( defence ) has been severely disrupted .\\nIn a way , it ’ s kinda reminiscent – to use a *very* loose example – of World War One .\\n[ and yes , i am deliberately massively oversimplifying with the labelling i ’ m deploying earlier in this paragraph ] Doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this change on one side , I mean .\\nSo , what you ’ re seeing is 3rd generation MBTs that were already rather outmoded in various ways – like , in service from the 1980s with various modernization efforts since … being destroyed in significant numbers by ATGMs that are … well , some are contemporary with their targets , others are much *much* more recent .\\nNow , the reason that this is worth noting is quite simple .\\nTurkey , as I have pointed out a few times elsewhere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tanks in Syria .\\nThere ’ s some controversy as to the purport of this , as the Turks were operating Leopard II A4s – and it hasn ’ t been settled how much better more modern refits of the vehicle might have proven in the situations in question .\\nWhat did they lose them to ?\\nMany of the same threats that the Russians are losing hardware to in Ukraine .\\nIndeed , not even ‘ the same threats ’ so much as older Russian / Soviet versions of such .\\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A similar situation is occurring in Yemen – wherein the Saudis are fielding ( and losing ) notable numbers of M1A2S American-made tanks .\\nThere ’ s , again , something of an open question as to just how qualitatively different the M1A2S is from the M1A2 SEP when it comes to armour etc .\\n… but the point remains the same : it ’ s relatively modern armour , being lost to potent anti-tank weaponry .\\nWhich is a helluvalot more concealable .\\nNow , none of this is presented as evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak ’ or ‘ stupid ’ American or German military or military design institutions .\\nPartially because it doesn ’ t suit a narrative to do so .\\nAnd partially , to be sure , because it appears in the Saudi case in particular that poor doctrine and tactical employment – in ways that leave Western observers “ wtf ” ing – is responsible for placing armour in such situations in the first place .\\nBut all up – it ’ s long been apparent that in order to actually have armour assets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ’ s .. a profusion of these kinds of threats , it ’ s simply not enough to have ERA bricks or even relatively advanced plating .\\nPending some truly revolutionary advances in the latter sphere , we ’ re currently at a place wherein it ’ s not easily possible for an armour platform to carry enough weight of armour on itself across enough of its body to protect against ATGM ( or even , in various cases , RPG ) threats .\\nWhat does this mean ?\\nUntil there ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against reasonably well-equipped infantry , armour assets are ‘ out of balance ’ quite significantly .\\nNow , to be fair and sure – the Israelis *have* been very pointed in their exploring and deployment of exactly these kinds of countermeasures ; and the Americans have been following suit .\\nIt is an interesting question whether they ’ d be in a similar position to the Russians currently were they faced with a similar ‘ hedgehog ’ .\\nWhile there ’ s some debate as to how effective ‘ kamikaze drones ’ might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think it ’ s a start.\\n” In short – it ’ s easy and evidently emotively satisfying to ascribe various occurrences to ‘ uniquely ’ terrible Russian hardware .\\nI do not dispute that equipment designed and built and haphazardly modernized over a course of several decades prior to the conflict it ’ s being employed in is often going to encounter difficulties .\\nBut the key thing is that many of the problems that have eventuated are decidedly not ‘ uniquely ’ Russian problems .\\nWe are simply observing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ’ re the ones currently putting forces into the field in an attempted invasion ( and so they are occurring to them ) ; ii ) the Ukrainian informational warfare effort has been a resounding success , and highlighted as much as possible both these difficulties and that it is Russians experiencing them .\\nOf course , it is certainly possible to argue that how the hardware in question has been employed has significantly contributed to these various losses .\\nIn many instances , I would not seek to disagree .\\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying something is intrinsically shoddy simply because it is Russian .\\nAnd it also doesn ’ t quite account for the fact that for various of these elements – even employing them at all has become significantly more hazardous than it was only a few years afore .\\nAll things considered , whenever I see some of the more outlandish guffawing from social media ( and even regular media ) commentators of the sort outlined above and proffering American or NATO hardware as seemingly impervious to similar challenges … my thoughts go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is from , but the latin verse it is rendering is from Horace : “ The poet has Tantalus , unable to satisfy his hunger or his thirst , turning on the spectator and demanding , Quid rides ?\\nMutato nomine , de te fabula narratur : why do you laugh ?\\nChange the names and the story is about you .\\n”',\n",

       "  'content': 'Exploring the revolutionary potential of Subsidiarity and Participatory Democracy .\\nIT WAS AT the United Auto Workers holiday resort at Lakeside State Park , just a few miles out of Port Huron , Michigan , where , on 15 June 1962 , the concept of “ participatory democracy ” was born .\\nSharing its birthday was the movement that would become known as the “ New Left ’ , along with the organisation that would give shape and purpose to the youth revolt of the 1960s and 70s – Students for a Democratic Society ( SDS ) .\\nBut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” and the notion of participatory democracy got to do with New Zealand politics in 2022 ?\\nThe answer to that question is inextricably bound up with another question : At what level should decisions that impact directly upon the daily lives of citizens , and the communities in which they live , be made ?\\nHow we answer that question is of immense importance , because the happiness of citizens and communities is all-too-often a reflection of their proximity to such decision-making ; and of how responsive the decision-makers are to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Berkeley Free Speech Movement made a slogan out of the instructions printed on the forms which the University of California at Berkeley required its students to complete .\\nIt read : “ Please do not fold , spindle or mutilate – I am a human-being.\\n” Those words capture brilliantly the deep sense of youthful alienation to which the SDS had given voice .\\nEverywhere institutions were getting bigger , more complicated , less intelligible and , increasingly , unaccountable .\\nThe student activists of the SDS saw it all around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post-war era .\\nThese vast “ knowledge factories ” , dedicated to furnishing corporate America with the highly-skilled and well-adjusted managers and professionals it demanded , left their youthful raw material feeling used and abused .\\nAnd it wasn ’ t just the universities that were folding , spindling and mutilating .\\nThe bureaucracies of the private sector : General Motors ; General Electric , Dow Chemicals , IBM ; were , if anything , larger ( and certainly less responsive ) than those of the public sector .\\nEven more troubling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people , by the people , for the people ” also showed signs of succumbing to the sins of bigness .\\nThe opaque political machines of the Democratic and Republican parties had turned folding , spindling and mutilating into an art form .\\nWhat did it say about American democracy , that Jack Kennedy , the best and the brightest presidential candidate in nearly 30 years , had to be elected by the votes of dead Democrats – courtesy of organised crime ?\\nOr that the very same Mafia “ outfits ” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade unions ?\\nNot the SDS ’ s sponsors in the United Auto Workers maybe , but most definitely Jimmy Hoffa ’ s Teamsters !\\nBig Business , Big Government , Big Unions , Big Universities – Big Gangsters !\\n– there had to be a better way !\\nBecause , as the Free Speech Movement ’ s leader , Mario Savio , so eloquently put it : “ There comes a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious , makes you so sick at heart , that you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ t even passively take part , and you ’ ve got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels , upon all the apparatus , and you ’ ve got to make it stop .\\nAnd you ’ ve got to indicate to the people who run it , the people who own it , that unless you ’ re free the machine will be prevented from working at all.\\n” Stirring rhetoric !\\nBut if Savio believed the sentiments he was expressing were new , then he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the machine ” is not a new thing , it goes back a long way .\\nAnd the sort of people and institutions who have given voice to that outrage might surprise you .\\nIt was in 1931 that Pope Pius XI issued the papal encyclical entitled Quadragesimo Anno in which the principle of subsidiarity was for the first time clearly enunciated by the Catholic Church : “ Just as it is gravely wrong to take from individuals what they can accomplish by their own initiative and industry and give it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an injustice and at the same time a grave evil and disturbance of right order to assign to a greater and higher association what lesser and subordinate organizations can do .\\nFor every social activity ought of its very nature to furnish help to the members of the body social , and never destroy and absorb them.\\n” It is important to locate these words in their historical context .\\nOnly then can the motivation of the Church – itself a large , rigid , and highly intricate hierarchy , with a global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nThe targets of Pius ’ s encyclical were , on the one hand , the unchecked rapaciousness of laissez-faire capitalism , and the amoral individualism which it had spawned ; and , on the other , the totalitarian ambitions of Italian Fascism , German National Socialism and Soviet Communism , which sought to drag all free-standing and self-regulating entities into the inescapable and smothering embrace of an ideologically-driven state .\\nPius argued that not only was the “ body social ” made healthier by governmental diversity , but so too was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the duties of church and state are merged .\\nBecause , as the novelist Robert Harris so rightly observes : “ If those with morals lack power , then those with power will lack morals.\\n” Historians are divided over how resolutely the Catholic Church defended the principle of subsidiarity – especially under the pontificate of Pius XI ’ s , Secretary of State , Cardinal Pacelli , who succeeded him as Pope Pius XII in March 1939 .\\nBranded “ Hitler ’ s Pope ” by his detractors , Pius XII nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acutely vulnerable vessels through pirate-infested waters .\\nThat two of the three pirate kings of the 1930s were dead by the time Pius XII brought all his little ships safely home is often forgotten by his critics .\\nAlso forgotten is the critical role played by the pontiff so often described as Pius XII ’ s spiritual successor , Pope John-Paul II , in bringing down the Soviet Union – the last of the pirate kingdoms .\\nCertainly , it was under the watchful eye of Pius XII that the principle of subsidiarity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout Western Europe .\\nAnd it wasn ’ t just the Catholic countries that embraced the new doctrine .\\nThe German Christian Democrats would become that country ’ s natural party of government .\\nIn the protestant Netherlands it also sent down deep roots .\\nYes , it helped that the Federal Republic of Germany ’ s first Chancellor , Conrad Adenauer , was a much-admired anti-Nazi .\\nBut , after Hitler , and in the grim shadow of Stalinism , Christian Democracy was able to hold out the promise of moderation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could do : the principle of subsidiarity acknowledged the beauty and resilience of small things .\\nVillages , towns , cities , regions : in each of these places stood institutions tested and refined by the passage of centuries ; modes of governance which recognised the special needs and preferences of their communities ; bodies which interposed themselves between the peremptory claims of the national , and the long-established rights and cherished privileges of the local .\\nThe gauleiters and commissars had swept all these away with totalitarian contempt , but the Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nNo wonder people voted for them !\\n“ Ah , but that is Europe !\\n” , I hear you say .\\n“ Europe isn ’ t merely old , it is ancient .\\nHistory there isn ’ t measured in decades , but in centuries and millennia .\\nObviously , subsidiarity works well alongside traditions as old as these .\\nBut , can it work in New Zealand ?\\nOurs is a nation which came into existence less than two centuries ago ?\\nWhat traditions do we have to rival those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German market towns ?\\nAlso , Europe is full of people : 500 million in the EU alone !\\nIn a nation whose population has just passed 5 million , how far down can power be passed before it ceases to be able to pay for itself ?\\n” For nearly four decades now this country ’ s political and economic leaders have studiously avoided the question of how government – national and local – is expected to pay for itself .\\nThat ’ s because , in 1984 , they convinced themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contracted out to the “ Free Market ” .\\nTaxes could be cut , public enterprises privatised , and the burden of regulation lightened to the point where it could scarcely be felt at all , and everything would be fine , because the Free Market knew best and the Free Market would provide .\\nExcept , of course , the Free Market isn ’ t really interested in keeping the water drinkable , the streets lit , the rubbish carried away , and the power on , or in providing any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided if people are to remain healthy and their communities habitable .\\nThat is to say , the private sector will not provide any of these services without first receiving an ironclad guarantee that they can be provided at a profit .\\nAnd what can Local Government say : except “ Yes , Sir ” ?\\nAnd what can Local Government do : except impose more user-charges and strike ever-higher rates ?\\nAnd what alternative does Local Government have when the rate-payers cry “ Enough !\\nNo more !\\n” : except to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and put off until tomorrow all the things that are crying out so urgently to be done today ?\\nAnd what does Local Government know : if not that the day must come when the pipes burst , and the water becomes contaminated , and people get sick , and some die , and the country ’ s mayors , councillors and managers are all lined up by the news media to take the blame and wear the shame ?\\nIt ’ s madness – utter madness – and it ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact .\\nMore importantly , it ’ s wrong .\\nThere is something dark and malignant behind the reality that our country no longer seems to work .\\nSomething every bit as dark and malignant as Hitler and Stalin : and just as totalitarian .\\nPope Pius XI knew what it was .\\nRemember the words of his Quadragesimo Anno ?\\nHe called it “ a grave evil and disturbance of right order ” .\\nIt flows from that other source of the Church ’ s growing alarm in 1931 .\\nThe forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Stalin .\\nUntrammelled capitalist greed , and the ruthless pursuit of individual wealth and power without heed for the consequences .\\nNot for the rest of humanity .\\nNot for the world they inhabit .\\nDo not fold , spindle or mutilate – I am a human-being .\\nBecause the abandonment of the principle of subsidiarity ( even in its birthplace , Europe ) and the universal enthronement of the most successful totalitarian ideology in human history , Neoliberalism , is very surely , but not at all slowly , destroying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human civilisation .\\nAnd to whom , as the planet swelters and pandemics sweep the globe , will people turn for aid and comfort in the years that lie ahead ?\\nTo the failed politicians in a distant capital city ?\\nTo the same political class whose reckless inaction precipitated the very crisis in which they now find themselves engulfed ?\\nTo the powerless servants of science , whose fate , like Cassandra ’ s , was to see the future clearly , but not be believed ?\\nNo , they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local councils : to the politicians and bureaucrats who serve their regions , districts , cities and towns .\\nThat word “ serve ” is used advisedly .\\nIt ’ s an old-fashioned word and an old-fashioned concept , but in spite of it falling out of favour , both linguistically and politically , service of one sort or another is inescapable .\\nHow does Bob Dylan put it ?\\nYou may be a preacher with your spiritual pride You may be a city councilman taking bribes on the side You may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may know how to cut hair You may be somebody ’ s mistress , may be somebody ’ s heir But you ’ re gon na have to serve somebody , yes You ’ re gon na have to serve somebody Well , it may be the devil or it may be the Lord But you ’ re gon na have to serve somebody The temptation is always to serve the already powerful : the people with the money ; the One Percent – for want of a better term .\\nBut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be resisted .\\nIt is never a good idea to be found standing too close to those who end up wearing the blame .\\nNo matter how much sense it may have made in the past to range oneself alongside those who scorn the very idea of popular participation , and who consider democracy to be an extremely inefficient form of government , it makes sense no longer .\\nPowering-up is what got us into this mess .\\nCreating bigger and bigger local government organisations – Three Waters anyone !\\n– sealing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; making them less and less accountable to the individuals and communities they were intended to serve ; none of it has made these local services any more efficient or effective – quite the opposite , in fact .\\nBy assigning to “ a greater and higher association what lesser and subordinate organizations can do ” the energy and creativity of the “ body social ” has indeed been absorbed and destroyed – just as Pope Pius XI predicted .\\nOnly by powering-down ; only by adopting the principle of subsidiarity ; can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice of participatory democracy feasible be brought into existence .\\nIs participatory democracy really that important ?\\nYes , it is , because without returning effective political power to the people , there is no possibility of also returning their resources .\\nNo one involved in the management of local government will have failed to notice the way in which central government has mastered the art of passing its responsibilities downwards – while withholding the resources needed to carry them out .\\nSuch is the fake subsidiarity of Neoliberalism : making the victims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own deprivation .\\nLike inviting someone to open a bank and then refusing to supply them with cash .\\nDoes subsidiarity have revolutionary implications ?\\nYes , of course it does .\\nIt will , however , be a revolution made on behalf of the particular , not the general .\\nYes , it will entail a radical re-ordering of our institutions , but not in the name of grand and universal objectives .\\nThis will be a revolution favouring the little and the local .\\nThe sort of change delivered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by levelling bulldozers and snarling chainsaws .\\nA revolution that has no interest in cutting things ( or people ) down , only in letting them grow .\\nIt is to New Zealand ’ s local authority politicians , bureaucrats and engineers that we must look for leadership in this revolution because , in truth , who else is there ?\\nOnly they have the expertise and the experience to keep the water drinkable , the streets lit , the rubbish carried away , and the power on .\\nOnly they understand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be maintained if people are to remain healthy and their communities habitable … when the pandemics rage and the skies change colour .\\nIt was Tip O ’ Neil , Speaker of the US House of Representatives , who popularised the observation “ all politics is local ” .\\nNow , he was the sort of old-style Democratic Party machine politician that the SDS wanted to get rid of .\\nWhat those young student activists failed to grasp , however , is that the only thing worse that a full pork barrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only way to keep the pork coming is to never let the politicians wheeling and dealing in the far away capital city forget where their votes come from .\\nIn the end , subsidiarity is about decisions that are hand-crafted – not mass-produced .\\nIt ’ s about governing in a way that keeps neighbours talking to one another , not shouting at one another .\\nIt ’ s about individuals passing some things up , so that other things can be passed down to their families and communities .\\nMost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government machinery that does not fold , spindle or mutilate the human-beings it is supposed to serve – and which every citizen can learn to operate .',\n",

       "  'content': 'THERE ARE MOMENTS IN HISTORY when all the options available to political leaders are bad .\\nThe British Prime Minister , Neville Chamberlain , faced such a moment in the late-1930s .\\nNew Zealand ’ s current political leadership is facing an equally fraught range of options .\\nAlready , there is no course of action available to either Jacinda Ardern or Christopher Luxon that does not , ultimately , end in tears .\\nHow did we arrive at such a dangerous moment ?\\nFor the beginnings of an answer we must look to the Bicultural Project developed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In its essence , this project was an attempt to retain the coherence of the New Zealand working-class by building a much greater level of cultural understanding between Pakeha and Māori workers , thereby ensuring that any improvements in living standards and political influence would benefit both ethnicities equally .\\nIn its first iteration , at least , the Bicultural Project was about class and culture .\\nA rising economic tide , born of working-class unity , would lift all boats – and waka .\\nMāori nationalists were having none of it .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Project was just another Pakeha ruse for remaining in charge of the evolution of the New Zealand state .\\nFrom the very beginning , nationalist writers – most notably Donna Awatere – were at pains to make it clear that the acquisition of Tino Rangatiratanga , Māori Sovereignty , would be achieved in spite of , not by the grace and favour of , the “ White Left ” .\\nMāori nationalists of aristocratic lineage evinced only scorn for the trade unions and the left-wing parties .\\nTheir goal was always admirably clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All of it .\\nNow .\\nPerhaps , if Rogernomics had never happened , some sort of compromise might have been reached .\\nWe ’ ll never know .\\nThe Neoliberal Revolution smashed the unity of the New Zealand working-class into a thousand pieces .\\nAs always in this country ’ s history , massive economic change hit Māori communities the hardest .\\nMeanwhile , what was left of the traditional Pakeha working-class was demobilised and disarmed by the Employment Contracts Act .\\nWithin a few years the White Left had ceased to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither needed nor wanted any sort of Left .\\nMāori nationalists found Neoliberalism ’ s take on the Bicultural Project much more encouraging than the Marxists ’ version .\\nLord Cooke of Thorndon ’ s 1987 “ partnership ” formulation of the Treaty relationship dovetailed neatly with the neo-tribal capitalism mandated by the Crown/Iwi-based Treaty Settlement Process .\\nThe resulting quasi-autonomous ethnic corporations , working hand-in-glove with the Executive Branch of the New Zealand state , were now on course to produce an entirely new set of constitutional possibilities .\\nThe relentless promotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within those institutions directly controlled by , and/or beholden to , the State , combined with a young Māori elite , educated by the Iwi corporates , and strategically located by sympathetic public servants at the myriad power-points of the state apparatus , transformed the human resources of the Crown into a powerful ideological force .\\nIn alliance with the free-floating Iwi corporations , the New Zealand state and its appendages – especially the major political parties , the mainstream news media and the universities – were now ready to proceed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as “ Co-Governance ” .\\nGiven the intense preparation which has gone into raising Māori expectations of co-governance , it would now be extremely dangerous for any political party to bring its institutional evolution to a halt .\\nThat said , the lack of any serious preparation of the non-Māori population for the revolutionary implications of setting New Zealand ’ s democratic political system aside in favour of “ parity ” between the Treaty “ partners ” , has already set in motion the growth of potentially massive electoral resistance to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expectation is that the National and Act parties will , between them , bring the “ anti-democratic ” innovations of “ Māori radicals ” to a shuddering halt .\\nThe vehicle for this moratorium is the Act Party ’ s “ bottom-line ” referendum on co-governance , the result of which the Right ( almost certainly correctly ) regards as a forgone conclusion .\\nShould National indicate in any way its reluctance to adhere to Act ’ s bottom-line , then its grip on the right-leaning electorate will be weakened profoundly – @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly bringing the NZ First Party back into Parliament .\\nOn the Centre-Left , by contrast , there is a growing level of apprehension that its steadily declining level of support – as registered in the opinion polls – will require not only the seats of Labour and the Greens , but also those of Te Pāti Māori , if “ progressives ” are to retain possession of the Treasury Benches .\\nWith support for Te Pāti Māori rising ( at the Greens ’ expense ) neither Labour nor the Greens will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commitment to the co-governance project .\\nEven within Te Pāti Māori , fears will be growing that the support it is attracting in the polls may not end up being reflected in the polling-booths .\\nYounger voters are notoriously difficult to mobilise , especially when compared to older voters ( who can be relied upon to cast their votes with an almost religious devotion ) .\\nTo get these younger voters “ off the couch ” , Te Pāti Māori will need to present the coming election as an existential threat to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Co-governance will thus be elevated to a non-negotiable component of the nation ’ s future .\\nLabour and the Greens will find themselves being dragged further and further to the left in order to keep this nascent Red-Green-Brown coalition together .\\nTo distract their still dubious working-class Pakeha supporters from the co-governance question , Labour may lay before them reforms aimed squarely at dismantling the neoliberal economic order in favour of “ real Labour policies ” .\\nWith the Greens and Te Pāti Māori shouting “ Me too !\\n” , it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to paint the forthcoming election as not only an existential threat to democracy , but also to the socio-economic status quo .\\nClearly , not everybody ’ s expectations can be fulfilled in a democratic election .\\nHistorically , the voters on either side of the political divide have understood and accepted this state of affairs .\\nThere is always next time .\\nThe risk New Zealand runs in 2023 is that the policy promises of the contending parties will be come to be seen by their respective supporters as critical to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right , the introduction of co-governance will be equated with the death of democracy .\\nOn the Left , a racist referendum endorsing the elimination of co-governance will be construed as an all-out assault on the Treaty of Waitangi and the indigenous people it was intended to protect .\\nIn such circumstances , the uncompromising partisans on both sides begin to believe that if they concede defeat there will be no “ next time ” .\\nAt that point the cry goes out for a “ continuation of politics by other means ” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceases to be an option – for anybody .',\n",

       "  'content': 'I kinda feel like the sentiment about Luxon ’ s apparent trainwreck of an interview with Jack Tame today is … not going to play out the way people think .\\nYes , yes it ’ s absolutely true and correct to state that Luxon wound up caught in a bunch of contradictions – between stuff he ’ s talking about and claiming is a problem , with what he ’ s actually prepared to do if he wins an election ; between things he ’ s said he intends to do , and how these actively feed into problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over … you get the idea .\\nMost people don ’ t have a coherent view of the universe – let alone something as infinitely more internecine as the politics of a small island nation .\\nOur world-views are awash as a morass of mutually contradictory preferences and outrage-inducing red-flag buttons .\\nSome people take a look at politicians and their presumptive visions – maybe even read some policy manifestos ( if anybody still does those ) or commentary upon same – before they decide on who they want to vote for .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ can ‘ trust ’ someone with power – and that may , indeed , arcen back to whether they can put on a decent showing in front of a camera in answering reasonably simple , straightforward questions .\\n( Answering … does not necessarily mean answering well or truthfully , necessarily – but that is another matter ) However , for an appreciable quotient of our body politik ( as with many other modern , Western democracies ) – what they ’ re looking for is a simple resonancy with things they already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or coaxed into believing .\\nAnd , as we have observed – that DOESN ’ T require an internally coherent worldview to be espoused by the politician courting them .\\nQuite the opposite .\\nIt just requires being able to sound-off a veritable checklist of talking-points or hot-button stances – and then let the natural artifice of human cognitive filtering take care of the rest .\\nPeople no longer ‘ hear ’ the contradictions , if the contradictions are things they ’ re already subconsciously overlooking in and of themselves when it comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Further , to add to all of this – it has long been known that New Zealanders tend to like an underdog , and will rally behind somebody who is perceived as ‘ not getting a fair go ’ .\\nI have repeatedly observed that in 2014 , for instance , the year of the Dirty Politics revelations … National ’ s vote actually went up , precisely because we automatically insistently minimized the impropriety at hand – at least partially because the media was perceived to be making a big deal out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Key was being hounded by the press and was being beaten up upon – so people tuned out just what ( and why ) he was being hounded over , and considered him a more sympathetic figure .\\nHelluva thing , really , to have a multi-millionaire incumbent Prime Minister of six years going up against a Labour party about to deliver its worst result since 1922 … and somehow have said PM come across as being the ‘ underdog ’ or ‘ marginalized ’ , but that ’ s how it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nTame ’ s interview was interesting and entertaining ; but a whole lot of people out there will , if anything , double down in their emergent support for Luxon .\\nNot because anything Luxon said or did in that performance was ‘ smart ’ or visionary .\\nBut rather precisely because we ’ ve all had a situation of some younger guy coming in and asking us ‘ twisty ’ questions [ which may , or may not , actually have been ‘ twisty ’ rather than reasonably direct and straightforward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] and feeling unfairly put upon in fairly direct consequence .\\nExposing that Luxon is not , in fact , ( yet ) the man to be able to dethrone Ardern does not induce his following to abandon ship .\\nBecause they ’ ve already begun to ‘ buy in ’ .\\nSo pointing out that the would-be emperor is , it would seem , somewhat bereft of clothing … just makes many all the more determined to dig in and declare they ’ re definitely backing a winner here and never mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrary .\\nOne of the ( many ) things George W.

       "  'content': 'A recent report on the property market in Stuff is headed : “ World watching NZ housing market as Auckland labeled ‘ canary in coal mine ’ ” The report notes that : “ The likes of Ireland and the UK have DTI caps between three and a half and four and a half times income .\\nIn New Zealand , customers with DTI of more than six account for 39 % of recent borrowing , Barrenjoey found after analysing Reserve Bank data .\\nAuckland was higher , with 51 % of recent borrowers taking out home loans at DTIs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at DTIs over eight .\\nIn the 1980s in NZ price to income was about 2 .\\nOther facts we need to be aware of • Real house prices have gone up 300 % since 2000 – an OECD record .\\nThe USA and OECD average is half that .\\n• Our household income to price ratio is also one of the worst .\\n• The value of NZ ’ s housing stock has gone from $ 250 billion to $ 1600 billion since 2000 .\\nIt has gone from 2 times GDP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period .\\nThis compares to 1.7 in the US .\\n• The Sharemarket is only worth 0.6 of GDP compared to 2.2 in the US .\\n• Current household debt as a share of income has doubled in the same period from 80-160 % .\\n• In addition , recent lending has been trending upwards to risky levels in terms of debt to income This makes the likelihood of a major housing downturn as part of the coming New Zealand recession almost inevitable .\\nThere Is simply no escape route from the capitalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will attack inflation .\\nBudget cutbacks and interest rate rises are the principal tools they have at their disposal to achieve that goal .\\nFor a period we will have “ Stagflation ” where we combine economic stagnation and continuing inflation .\\nThis is the worst of all possible worlds for working people .\\nInflation is back worldwide and with it is the blame game .\\nCentral Banks and governments want to blame the Pandemic associated lockdowns and shortages or Ukraine War .\\nAn impending worldwide recession in late 2019 was followed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led Central Banks and governments worldwide to embark on a massive amount of money printing and government spending to prevent a broad economic collapse .\\nWorld production and and trade was then disrupted by economic closedowns that were imposed as public health measures to combat the impacts of the Pandemic .\\nThe Central Banks then doubled down on money printing in response .\\nThis was led by the US Federal Reserve .\\n“ To understand the magnitude of the Fed ’ s money printing , we need to go back 22 months ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was $ 4.0192 trillion in circulation .\\nOn January 4 , 2021 , the number increased to $ 6.7 trillion dollars .\\nThen the Fed went into overdrive .\\nBy October 2021 , that number climbed to $ 20.0831 trillion dollars in circulation.\\n” Since January 2020 , the US has printed nearly 80 % of all US dollars in existence .\\nAll of the central banks have followed a similar policy .\\nThe New Zealand Central Bank Balance sheet went from an average of $ 20 billion in the 1990s to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over $ 90 billion currently .\\nThe monopolies that dominate global production and trade then seized whatever opportunities of genuine or manipulated shortages to impose price gouging wherever they could .\\nMost Central Banks ( including New Zealand ) ignored the growing inflation and tried to simply blame the temporary supply chain problems .\\nRightwing pro-capitalist economic and political voices that would normally raise alarms at the risks to their economic system by such measures stayed silent as well as they sense their system had dodged the bullet of a broad economic collapse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extraordinary explosion in the asset wealth of the 1 % globally was also a factor in muting criticism as well I don ’ t doubt .\\nBut today we have inflation averaging 7 % over much of the globe including the central advanced capitalist countries in North America .\\nEurope , and Australasia .\\nIn Japan , the inflation is lower for now but their currency has started depreciating significantly .\\nThese are numbers not seen for decades .\\nTwo important economies , Turkey and Argentina , have inflation rates of 50-60 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the continuation of current policies if ignored , will unleash hyperinflation that will destroy the value of the US dollar and end its role as the world currency .\\nFrom the point of view of the 1 % that is something that must be prevented at all costs .\\nThis was threatened once before in the 1970s when US inflation hit 13 % and required what was dubbed the “ Volker Shock ” in the name of the then US Federal Reserve Director Paul Volker who pushed the official cash rate up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar .\\nGovernment spending on welfare and education was also targeted for cuts .\\nAiming for a budget surplus became economic orthodoxy although this was only achieved temporarily in the US given the demands of its permanent wars of empire across the globe .\\nAfter the inflationary 1970s in New Zealand , we had our own version of the Volker Shock under the new Labour Government elected in 1984 and the official cash rate reached an all-time high in March of 1985 of 67.32 % !\\nVariable mortgage rates hit 20 % .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the business of lending money rather than producing goods were massively advantaged .\\nThat is the economic origin of financialisation and de-industrialisation in the advanced capitalist countries as literally , General Electric became GE Capital .\\nThe one percent don ’ t care how they make their money .\\nAccumulated wealth is stored in financial or non-financial assets .\\nHistorically this was broadly 50/50 in share but a gap has opened in favour of financial assets since 2008 .\\nThe 1 % hate inflation with a passion as it reduces their financial asset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the last analysis , they determine central bank and government policies on these matters and the war on inflation will be declared as absolutely essential for a nation ’ s economic survival .\\nFor the right-wing politicians and monetarist economists , the fault lies with too much government spending and too much central bank money printing , and to a certain extent they are correct .\\nBroad-based inflation is in the last analysis a monetary problem .\\nIn the 1970s the principal means of creating money and fueling inflation was to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than they took in taxes .\\nThe US also needed money to finance the war in Vietnam .\\nThe economic orthodoxy at that time became known as Keynesianism after the UK economist John Maynard Keynes .\\nKeynes was an upper-class classical pro-capitalist free-market economist but accepted something must be wrong with the classical view when the theoretically impossible economic depression happened in the 1930s .\\nHe came to the view that a budget deficit is alright at times to stimulate demand and employment .\\nPrime Minister Robert Muldoon in New Zealand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Keynesian policies in the 1980s despite their right-wing views on other matters .\\nKeynes also had a cost-plus view of inflation so it was always in the last analysis the worker ’ s fault when prices started rising and his solutions involved wage controls to cut wages when that happened .\\nBoth Nixon and Muldoon followed this aspect of Keynes ’ s policies as well .\\nHowever , after the deep recession following the Volker Shock budget deficit financing was sharply curtailed – especially spending on working people – like welfare , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also routinely starved .\\nCentral Banks like New Zealand were made “ independent ’ with the exclusive goal of targeting inflation to keep it low .\\nA central bank can create money by simply printing it electronically .\\nWhat that gets used for however is something that can be different in different periods .\\nIn the US they used the money to buy up bonds from distressed banks and industrial corporates to prevent them from going under .\\nIn New Zealand , $ 28 billion was given virtually free to the banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nThey gave most of it to property speculators who drove up prices by 30 % in one year .\\nAnother $ 100 billion was made available to the government to use to prop up businesses during the pandemic .\\nThis allows the government to run big budget deficits without worrying about if the market can absorb the amount needed in the short term .\\nThis is “ unorthodox ” by any measure but was considered necessary by governments and central banks across the capitalist world as the crisis hit .\\nWorld capitalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis with massive money printing dubbed “ quantitative easing ” .\\nInterest rates were driven to rock bottom as part of the process .\\nDebt in all forms – personal , corporate , or state-owned – massively increased as well .\\nA significant number of debtors of any type can not survive even a modest increase in rates The return to orthodoxy means the central bank must retire the bonds that it has created by buying them back and pushing up interest rates to do so .\\nBut the budget deficits are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of creating spending artificially – a form of money creation but different from the central banks printing money directly .\\nThis will inevitably induce a recession over the next year or so .\\nThis is true for the rest of the globe as well .\\nIn fact , the poorer countries are being hit by a double whammy of war-induced shortages and prices rises for basic food , fertiliser , and other commodities .\\nThis will accentuate the downturn .\\nThere is also no chance of QE being deployed to tackle the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new analysis , during the pandemic ’ s second year ( from March 2021 to March 2022 ) , the IMF approved 23 loans to 22 countries in the Global South – all of which either encouraged or required austerity measures .\\nThe International Monetary Fund has announced that the global economy is entering a major slowdown , downgrading the growth prospects of 143 countries .\\nAt the same time , inflation rates have reached historic levels .\\nAround the world , hundreds of millions of people are falling into poverty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has sounded the alarm that we are ‘ witnessing the most profound collapse of humanity into extreme poverty and suffering in memory ’ .\\nThis government of New Zealand has actually said it wants to go back to budget surpluses as soon as possible .\\nThis is economically illiterate .\\nIt is akin to a religious dogma rather than economic science .\\nBut it was a dogma adopted by the previous term of the Labour Government from 1999 to 2008 .\\nThis is not economically necessary in New Zealand which has one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any advanced capitalist country .\\nA modest deficit is actually possible permanently so long as the economy is growing and the debt to GDP ratio can even trend down with one .\\nGovernment surpluses actually have the negative impact of withdrawing money from circulation and contracting rather than expanding economic growth .\\nAlso , the deficit could be reduced from the current high levels by increasing taxation on wealth to supplement all the taxes workers pay but that seems unlikely in the foreseeable future .\\nRefusing to tax wealth at all includes nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encourages a huge weight being given and taken by the property market in the New Zealand economy .\\nThere are also two funds with over $ 100 billion between them that could be taken and used for an emergency like this .\\nThese are the funds for future national superannuation and ACC payments that could be directed to be funding the massive infrastructure deficit the country has .\\nThese funds were created for ideological , not economic reasons .\\nThe ACC fund was created to stop it from being a pay-as-you-go system to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund to cover future claims because it was being prepared for privatisation .\\nThe fund was created by overtaxing us in ACC payments .\\nThe privatisation was stopped by Labour in 1999 but the fund remained and the penny-pinching insurance model which aggressively denies entitlements also remained .\\nThe $ 40 billion could be taken and used for investments in infrastructure while ACCS was restored to being a pay-as-you-go system with a culture of entitlement , not denial .\\nThe Superfund was also established by the 1999-2008 Labour government to allow an even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than be spent on things like public transport , water , or climate change .\\nIt now has $ 58 billion accumulated .\\nA fictitious panic was promoted that national super would become unaffordable in the future and we need a special fund to save for the future expenditure that will be needed .\\nNo government in the world thinks it is so incompetent that it can not prepare for the future by spending appropriately now on infrastructure , health and education needs to make the economy more productive to be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nThis is doubly the case when they could tax wealth and choose not to .\\nThe Finance Minister at the time , Michael Cullen , used the fund to keep money out of the hands of the other ministers who wanted to spend it on their needs .\\nThe coming crisis will threaten the viability of New Zealand ’ s banking system given its almost total reliance on lending for property ( including agriculture ) .\\nIt is probable the banks will need to be rescued from their own reckless expansion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US and Europe , many banks were nationalised after the 2008 crisis only to be handed back to the thieves who created the crisis in the first place .\\nThis should not happen in New Zealand .\\nBanking and insurance should be public services dedicated to meeting people ’ s needs , not profit-gouging thieves .\\nThe only alternative is to nationalise the banks and insurance companies without compensation to the shareholders who have robbed us blind for decades .\\nThis will allow the state to take control of the debt mountain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homeowners and the many farmers who are also likely to be in a dire position once a global recession happens .\\nIt will also put the state in charge of all forms of money creation , including that of the banks in the form of credit creation which should be controlled to avoid inflationary surges like we saw in housing .\\nThe banks have also been central to the transformation of much of New Zealand agriculture into dairy production – a debt bomb-laden , soil degrading , and water-poisoning economic operation .\\nAn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Green New Deal to save the people and the planet then needs to be implemented .\\nThe alternative economic plan must not be dependent on commodity production for profit and the relentless and endless degradation of the planet .\\nWe must end all participation in the wars of empire we are currently engaged in to protect our own oligarchies in the so-called West that control , exploit and degrade human life and the planet in our part of the globe .\\nWorking people have no side in these wars .',\n",

out to Winston Peters , Matt King , and ( reportedly ) other former MPs , trespassing them from Parliament Grounds for two years .\\nThen , just 24 hours after that story breaks , Hobson ’ s Pledge inserts a full-page ad ’ in The Herald spoofing the Star Wars franchise and announcing an “ Attack On The Votes ” .\\nPutting to one side the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editorial team , in spite of ruling an ad ’ from the group Speak Up For Women ( featuring nothing more inflammatory than the dictionary definition of “ woman ” ) too much for its readers to bear , was nevertheless prepared to wear whatever harm

commitment ) to core democratic principles .\\nAt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentrated in the older age-groups of the population .\\nThese are the New Zealanders who came of age at a time when the two main political parties represented clear and distinct approaches to defining and securing the public good .\\nThe votes cast by New Zealanders in those far-off days steered the nation leftwards or rightwards in ways that must seem quite odd to those accustomed to the unchanging neoliberal parameters of MMP .\\nThat the National Party won more frequently than Labour was disappointing but not disheartening to Labour ’ s supporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planets did finally come into alignment for their party , then big changes would follow .\\nChanges which , historically , National was more likely to come to terms with than to overturn .\\nIn short , older New Zealanders can still remember when politics worked .\\nMore to the point , they can remember when even those who placed themselves on the right of the political spectrum accepted that what Martin Luther King called “ the great arc of history ” was bending in the direction of justice .\\nThey , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very edge of the moral precipice over which right-wing extremism had attempted to drag humanity .\\nPeople who still thought that way – even after Auschwitz – were kept at the outermost margins of political life .\\nThe vile content of the letters they sent to the nation ’ s editors never saw the light of day .\\nTheir fascistic ravings were routinely filed in the nearest rubbish bin .\\nWith New Zealanders under 40 , however , all this political nostalgia gains little purchase .\\nPolitics hasn ’ t swerved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becoming in the Twenty-First Century a battle between marketing strategies , not ideologies .\\nYoung New Zealanders critique political advertisements in the way their parents and grandparents once critiqued the major parties ’ election manifestoes .\\nThe “ look ” and “ tone ” of a political leader counts for much more than any ideas they might have .\\nWhat matters most is that the leader of “ your ” party doesn ’ t come off looking and sounding like a “ dick ” .\\n“ Democracy ” no longer enjoys the universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world when its stood over the broken bodies of fascism and militarism at the end of World War II .\\nAs Dame Anne Salmond reminded Newsroom

today ’ s younger voters , those same younger voters are more likely to consider them an extremely dubious set of philosophical assumptions .\\nWhere , for example , does the “ spirit of brotherhood ” leave the women of the world ?\\n“ Democracy ” in the Twenty-First Century offers electorates almost nothing in the way of alternative economic policies .\\nEconomics is no longer deemed a suitable subject for the sort of robust political contestation that distinguished the political parties of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Age of Neoliberalism , the economic principles by which a nation is governed have become fixed .\\nPoliticians do not challenge these principles , restricting themselves to debating which party is best equipped to implement them most effectively and efficiently .\\nFor young people on the losing side of the economic – that is to say class – struggle , it makes absolutely no difference whether Labour or National is in power .\\nNeither party would dream of stepping beyond the bounds of neoliberal orthodoxy .\\nNo matter which political formation occupies the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more affordable , poverty is not alleviated , unions remain peripheral , and Climate Change is not seriously addressed .\\nAs the Anarchist slogan puts it : “ Don ’ t bother voting – the politicians always win.\\n” The situation we face in 2022 bears comparison with the years following World War I

a busted flush .\\nAs in the 1920s and 30s , the most radical political ideologies of the Twenty-First Century are dedicated to the nature of human identity and the possibility of human transformation .\\nEthnicity and nationality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the possibility of transformation continues to drive the Left .\\nWhere the Soviets dreamt of creating a wholly new kind of human-being – homo sovieticus – the modern identarian Left dream of the evolutionary leaps made possible by the elimination of oppression and privilege .\\nDreams on this scale can not be achieved by the tawdry compromises of democratic politics .\\nThe key objective of both the Far-Right and the Far-Left is to conquer the political apparatus and harness it to the all-important task of human transformation .\\nThe modern ideologue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ordinary citizens for the modest purposes of achieving all those ordinary things that make life safe and comfortable .\\nSafety and comfort are Kryptonite to the radical political personality .\\nGuided more by intuition than ideology , Hobson ’ s Pledge “ gets ” the totalitarian implications of a political project driven not by what people actually want , but what they shouldwant .\\nIts choice of the Star Wars franchise to hang its publicity campaign on is a shrewd one .\\nFor what is George Lukas ’ s fantasy if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heroes and villains ,

at the hip .\\nAs the progressives of our own time say : “ Science has a left-wing bias.\\n” Where science reigns , so , too , does social-democracy .\\nHaving seen what bigotry produced , the nations of Western Europe – @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social and economic policies that sought to provide the greatest amount of “ good ” things – universal healthcare , free education , affordable and secure accommodation , a rational electoral system – to the greatest number .\\nPresident Lyndon Johnson ’ s “ Great Society ” programmes of the middle-1960s , building upon President Franklin Roosevelt ’ s “ New Deal ” programmes of the 1930s , strongly suggested that , with science in the saddle , the USA was headed , irreversibly , in the same direction .\\nAmerica ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of it .\\nTo head-off the possibility of a science-driven , social-democratic United States ( in which the power of capitalism would inevitably begin to wane ) they adopted a dual strategy of resistance .\\nFirst of all , they made it possible for capitalism to advance its own “ science ” against the “ left-wing ” ( i.e .\\ngenuine ) science that was inflicting so much damage upon their cause .\\nBy endowing university departments and setting up their own think-tanks and research journals , the capitalist string-pullers were soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific enemy .\\nAmerican capitalism ’ s second line of attack was to do everything possible to encourage irrationality and anti-scientific prejudice – most particularly among working-class Americans .\\nBy funding and encouraging the revival of fundamentalist Christianity it was able to unleash the so-called “ culture wars ” .\\nReligious faith was pitted against scientific knowledge .\\nCreationism confronted Darwin ’ s Theory of Evolution in school boards across the United States .\\nBefore long scientists began to be regarded as the evil agents of Satan .\\nKicking-off in the 1970s , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had , by the second decade of the Twenty-First Century , forced uncorrupted scientists onto the defensive .\\nFrom the deadly effects of tobacco and sugar , to the looming catastrophe of Global Warming , the capitalists ’ “ scientists ” had denied and delayed effective remedial action to devastating effect .\\nOn the irrational front , things were going equally well .\\nBy the year 2020 more than half of all Americans preferred the Bible ’ s creation story to Darwin ’ s .\\nIndeed , so successful was American capitalism ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Covid-19 pandemic struck , roughly half of the American population declined to follow the scientific advice of the Centre for Disease Control .\\nThe Coronavirus has now killed more Americans than all the wars they have fought in their far-from-peaceful history .\\nWhat does this depressing historical narrative have to tell New Zealanders .\\nThe most obvious lesson is , surely , that we are no less the victims of the bogus “ science ” of American capitalism ’ s propaganda machine than the people of the USA themselves .\\nIn the decade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government and the election of the Fourth , the neoliberal ideology was injected slowly – and largely invisibly – into the bloodstream of the New Zealand establishment .\\nWhat proved more difficult to replicate here was the resurrection of irrationalism , bigotry and religious extremism that had proved so crucial to the rescue of American capitalism .\\nNew Zealand Christianity , at least as a mass phenomenon , crashed in the early 1970s ( thanks largely to our free , secular , and science-driven public education system ) and in spite of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has failed to rise again .\\nBut , where the miracle-workers of right-wing Kiwi Christianity have failed , the miracle-workers of Silicon Valley have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams .\\nIn this country , the rise and rise of social-media has opened the door to all kinds of irrational beliefs and conspiracy theories – greatly facilitating the undermining of scientific authority – especially medical science .\\nThis attack on science has been greatly assisted by the Covid-19 Pandemic which has acted as the vector for the rapid spread of American-sourced social pathologies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequences of this other pandemic are likely to be severe .\\nWe have already witnessed the response of New Zealand capitalism to a government willing to be guided by “ the science ” .\\nWe have also noted the capitalists ’ near complete success in reasserting the priorities of commerce over public welfare .\\nIn the cultural context , however , the single-minded campaigning of the business community is largely absent .\\nWhat New Zealand faces instead is a potentially devastating collision of irrationalities .\\nThe quasi-religious certainties of the so-called “ woke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gender – are already crashing head-on into right-wing groups angered and frightened by the radical transformation of New Zealand which the Woke propose .\\nWhat threatens is a perfect storm of competing bigotries : ideological antagonists united only in their determination to shout down and shut out the voices of reason .\\nThe imminent overturning of Roe versus Wade by the US Supreme Court is certain to raise echoes here that are no less evocative of the dystopia envisioned by Margaret Atwood in The Handmaid ’ s Tale .',\n",

an ordinance over the West Bank called “ Procedure for Entry and Residence for Foreigners in Judea and Samaria Area ” .\\nOrdinance laws are passed by municipalities which are , in turn , political subdivisions of a state .\\nIn legal terms , this move clearly demonstrates Israel ’ s determination to annex the West Bank .\\nThe Zionist regime arrogantly assumes a right to control entry to the West Bank over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Palestinian people themselves as foreigners in their own land .\\nWhile Israelis are able to travel freely in and out of the West Bank , just as they can within Israel itself , all Palestinian movement around the West Bank is subjected to strict control .\\nMost of Israel ’ s 712-kilometre long so-called ‘ Separation Wall ‘ stands upon Palestinian land .\\nSome

has ruled on the illegality of Israel ’ s Wall .\\nIn many areas , access to their agriculture for Palestinian farmers is severely limited and even denied .\\nThe ‘ Separation Wall ‘ is still under construction and , if completed , would seize 46 % of the West Bank .\\nWithin what is left of the West Bank , the Israeli Occupation imposes draconian travel limitations upon the population .\\nMilitary checkpoints are the main tool for this and there are hundreds of them .\\nMany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so-called ‘ flying ’ pop-up checkpoints appear without warning , causing even more costly and disruptive inconvenience .\\nWestern-aligned governments and mainstream news media ignore these humiliating travel restrictions , accepting them , without question , as necessary for Israel ’ s ‘ security ’ and ‘ defence ’ .\\nAs an on-line article in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz explains , the aim of flying checkpoints is to “ undermine Palestinians ’ control over their daily routine ” .\\nWritten by a Jewish Israeli lawyer , married to a Palestinian resident of Ramallah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dystopian daily interferences with normal travel that Israel imposes upon the West Bank .\\nIsrael ’ s fake security narrative is a cover , not only for colonisation but also for the development and marketing of surveillance technology and population-control .\\nIsrael ‘ s military Occupation is not just about land acquisition .\\nThere is no hurry to annex the whole of the West bank because its captive population is useful for the development of highly profitable surveillance technology and population-control .\\nIsrael ’ s surveillance spyware giant the NSO group ‘ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to spy on hundreds of journalists , human rights supporters and activists worldwide .\\nThe company , which claims that its foreign sales are licensed by Israel ’ s Defence Ministry , was purchased by its Israeli co-founders from the California-based Francisco Partners .\\nTowards

rights defenders who , while co-operating closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israeli war crimes in the West Bank and Gaza Strip , were accused of terrorism by Israel .\\nLast month , The Times of Israel reported that an imprisoned Palestinian lawyer , Salah Hamouri , was suing the Pegasus spyware maker NSO in a French Court .\\nHamouri , a French citizen , was incarcerated by an Israeli military court in March as a “ threat to security.\\n” The International Federation for Human Rights ( FIDH ) , the Human Rights League ( LDH ) , and Hamouri filed the complaint with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two illegal

Heritage Site in Danger .\\nIt is known as “ Land of Olives and Vines – Cultural Landscape of Southern Jerusalem , Battir ” and is unique in its traditional farming , ancient terraces and irrigation channels .\\nUNESCO describes the land thus : “ The Battir hill landscape comprises a series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with characteristic stone terraces , some of which are irrigated for market garden production , while others are dry and planted with grapevines and olive trees .\\nThe development of terrace farming in such a mountainous region is supported by a network of irrigation channels fed by underground sources .\\nA traditional system of distribution is then used to share the water collected through this network between families from the nearby village of Battir.\\n” In recent years , around 50 agricultural settlement outposts have been introduced in the Occupied West Bank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost , settlers are able to take over huge amounts of land to dispossess Palestinian farmers and turn it into pastureland .\\nThese land-grabs are made , often violently , while the Israeli military Occupation constantly prevents Palestinians from developing the land for their own needs .\\nThe settlers want the Palestinians out and the Occupation has obliged , issuing eviction orders and destroying Palestinian agriculture , including crops .\\nIn November last year , the Occupation ( termed by Israel as ‘ Civil Administration ’ ) demolished Palestinian terraces and uprooted dozens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near Battir .\\nOn 10 February this year , Michael Benyair , Israel ’ s former Attorney-General and acting judge in the Israeli Supreme Court , the following observation : “ I have spent my career analysing Israel ’ s most pressing legal questions .\\nIsrael ’ s occupation of

“ with great sadness ” that “ my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral depths that it is now an apartheid regime .\\nIt is time for the international community to recognise this reality as well.\\n” Benyair also admonished the international community saying that its “ delay in taking meaningful steps to hold Israel accountable for the apartheid regime it is perpetuating is unacceptable.\\n” Israeli High Court

Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been seized by the Israeli military and designated as a ‘ firing zone ’ for military exercises .\\nSince then , the people of the land that had lived there for generations have been appealing for the return of their land .\\nThe Court ruling sided with the Israeli Army , allowing for the demolition of eight small villages in Masafer Yatta , near Hebron .\\nThe European Union Delegation Representative , Sven Kühn von Burgsdorff , responded by warning that the expulsions would be a breach of Israel ’ s obligation as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world that “ the residents , many of whom , also exposed to settler violence , are at risk of forcible transfer ” , adding “ beyond a devastating impact on children , women and families , expulsion would be in breach of Israel ’ s obligations as the occupying power , a violation of international law and basic human rights.\\n” The Association for Civil Rights in Israel ( ACRI ) declared : “ The High Court has officially authorised leaving entire families , with their children and their elderly , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the world ’ s most cossetted and rewarded state , is massively supported both financially and diplomatically by the USA , under the influence of the Israel lobby .\\nThe USA proudly tells the world that “ Israel is a great partner to the United States , and Israel has no greater friend than the United States.\\n” This alliance includes shameless support for Israel ’ s defiance towards the United Nations and disrespect for international law .\\nThe US reminds us that it was the “ first to recognise Jerusalem as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem has never been recognised internationally and , on 21 December the same year , the United Nations General Assembly reacted with the passing of Resolution ES‑10/L.22 , declaring Israel ’ s claim on Jerusalem as its capital to be “ null and void ” .\\nTo be absolutely clear , the Resolution stated “ any decisions and actions which purport to have altered the character , status or demographic composition of the Holy City of Jerusalem have no legal effect , are null and void and must be rescinded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Security Council.\\n” The United States admits its “ commitment to Israel ’ s security is supported by robust defence co-operation ” with a “ 10-year , $ 38 billion Memorandum of Understanding ( MOU ) ” and an annual provision of $ 3.3 billion in Foreign Military Financing .\\nOn top of that , there are also $ 500 million “ co-operative programmes for missile defence.\\n” The US also indulges in joint military exercises with Israel as well as weapons development .\\nThere are , internationally , powerful interests that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control , unhindered by humanitarian considerations .\\nThe virtually unconditional support that Israel enjoys threatens the very survival of the tragically hard-won Fourth Geneva Convention .\\nDefying the United Nations and treating international law with contempt undermine stability and endanger peace .\\nThe survival of humanity now , more than at any time in history , requires respect for human rights and the curtailing of selfish advantage-taking .',\n",

Ardern and her colleagues since National eclipsed Labour in the polls is the risible politics of “ anything you can do I can do better ” .\\nImitation may be the sincerest form of flattery , but , in electoral politics , flattering your enemies is not a winning formula .\\nAt the core of the Government ’ s supine response to National ’ s reflexive policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuelling moral panics on education and youth offending , getting tough on gangs , racist dog-whistling on He Puapua and co-governance ; is the Centre-Left ’ s besetting fear that fighting-back against the Right will cost it votes .\\nTeasing out this core anxiety , it soon becomes clear that the Centre-Left ’ s fear arises from its conviction that the overwhelming majority of the electorate is susceptible to the ideological arguments of the Right .\\nThat being the case , it only makes sense for them to inoculate themselves against the Right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too !\\n” But , if the electorate is susceptible to the Right ’ s policy pitches , then it is only because it has been years since they heard the Left come to them with anything remotely resembling a passionately argued case for radical change .\\nOne would have to go all the way back to the general election of 1993 : to the Alliance ’ s left-wing manifesto ( which attracted 18.3 percent of the popular vote ) to hear a political party ask for the electorate ’ s help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to understand the Left ’ s reticence on matters of policy .\\nCertainly the Labour Party ’ s history argues strongly in favour of implementing radical change without apology and defending the gains made against all comers .\\nAfter governing for 14 years , Labour had the satisfaction of losing power to a National Party which had only become electorally competitive by pledging to keep the core economic and social reforms of the First Labour Government in place .\\nIt is possible to argue that Labour repeated that feat with Rogernomics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rally its supporters against the Lange Government ’ s “ more market ” reforms in 1987 , the National Party embraced with frightening enthusiasm in the days and weeks immediately following the 1990 general election .\\nTo make this case , however , it is necessary to argue that Labour found it impossible to grasp the ideological and electoral implications of National ’ s wholesale conversion to Neoliberalism .\\nFollowing the Mother of All Budgets and the Employment Contracts Act , Labour ’ s continued adherence to the core elements of the neoliberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same position as National between 1950 and 1984 .\\nBy refusing to abandon Rogernomics , Labour began its long , slow decline into an attenuated version of its principal electoral rival .\\nA party equally committed to maintaining the neoliberal status quo .\\nNational Lite .\\nAll attempts by Labour ’ s rank-and-file membership – especially following the Alliance ’ s demise in 2002 – to put an end the Parliamentary Labour Party ’ s love affair with neoliberalism ended in failure .\\nThe enthusiastic Rogernome , Phil Goff , was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social-democratic programme forced upon him by the likes of Helen Kelly , Marion Hobbs and Michael Wood .\\nLabour ’ s dismal Party Vote of 2011 – just 28 percent – was taken by the Labour Right as proof that stepping away from the status-quo could only end in disaster .\\nUndaunted , the Labour Left continued to agitate for a final repudiation of neoliberalism , even managing to elect the only mildly apostatic David Cunliffe as the Party ’ s leader .\\nOutraged at this rank insubordination , a majority of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are now senior Cabinet Ministers – made it clear that Cunliffe ’ s support within the Caucus was weak , vulnerable and unequal – intellectually , emotionally and politically – to the task it had set itself .\\nPerhaps unsurprisingly , in the 2014 general election Labour crashed to an even worse defeat – just 25 percent of the Party Vote .\\nThe Party was now in the unenviable position of being unable to go either forward or back .\\nWith a clear majority of Labour MPs vehemently opposed to abandoning neoliberalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organisation conducting a ruthless purge of all those who had promoted and supported Cunliffe , the leadership of Andrew Little was characterised by a steady retreat from

       "  'content': 'Sadly , the Philippines has sold its soul .\\nThirty six years ago a People Power revolution ousted the dictator Ferdinand Marcos after two decades of harsh authoritarian rule .\\nYesterday , in spite of a rousing and inspiring Pink Power would-be revolution , the dictator ’ s only son and namesake “ Bongbong ” Marcos Jr seems headed to be elected 17th president of the Philippines .\\nAnd protests have broken out after the provisional tallies that give Marcos a “ lead of millions ” with more than 97 percent of the cote counted .\\nOfficial results could still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 36 years after ousting dictator Marcos , Filipinos elect son as president Along with Bongbong , his running mate Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte , daughter of strongman Rodrigo Duterte , president for the past six years and who has been accused of human rights violations over the killings of thousands of alleged suspects in a so-called “ war in drugs ” , is decisively in the lead as vice-president .\\nOn the eve of the republic ’ s most “ consequential election ” in decades , Filipina journalism professor Sheila Coronel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University ’ s Toni Stabile School of Investigative Journalism in New York , said the choice was really simple .\\n“ The election is a battle between remembering and forgetting , a choice between the future and the past.\\n” Significantly more than half of the 67.5 million voters have apparently chosen to forget – including a generation that never experienced the brutal crackdowns under martial law in 1972-1981 , and doesn ’ t want to know about it .\\nYet 70,000 people were jailed , 35,000 were tortured , 4000 were killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ s erosion of democracy After six years of steady erosion of democracy under Duterte , is the country now about to face a fatal blow to accountability and transparency with a kleptomaniac family at the helm ?\\nDictator Marcos is believed to have accumulated $ 10 billion while in power and while Philippine authorities have only been able to recover about a third of this though ongoing lawsuits , the family refuses to pay a tax bill totalling $ 3.9 billion , including penalties .\\nIn many countries the tax violations would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the presidency .\\n“ A handful of other autocrats were also busy stealing from their people in that era – in Haiti , Nicaragua , Iran – but Marcos stole more and he stole better , ” according to The Guardian ’ s Nick Davies .\\n“ Ultimately , he emerges as a laboratory specimen from the early stages of a contemporary epidemic : the global contagion of corruption that has since spread through Africa and South America , the Middle East and parts of Asia .\\nMarcos was a model of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running high outside the main office of the Commission on Elections ( Comelec ) in Intramuros , Manila , today as protests erupted over the “ unjust ” election process and the expected return of the Marcoses to the Malacañang Palace .\\nThe Comelec today affirmed its dismissal of two sets of cases – or a total four appeals – seeking to bar Marcos Jr. from the elections due to his tax conviction in the 1990s .\\nRuling after the elections The ruling was released a day after the elections , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former senator was on the brink of winning the presidency .\\nIt wasn ’ t entirely surprising , as five of the seven-member Comelec bench had earlier voted in favour of the former senator in at least one of the four anti-Marcos petitions that had already been dismissed One further appeal can be made before the Supreme Court .\\nAs mounting allegations of election fraud and cheating greeted the provisional ballot trends , groups began filing formal complaints .\\nOne watchdog , Bakla Bantay Boto , said it had received “ numerous reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and an absurd [ number ] of broken vote counting machines ( VCMs ) ” throughout the Philippines .\\n“ Intensified violence has also marked today ’ s election .\\nPoll watchers have been tragically killed in Buluan , Maguindanao and Binidayan , Lanao del Sur , while an explosive was detonated in a voting centre in Kobacan , Cotabato .\\n“ The violent red-tagging of several candidates and party lists [ was ] also in full force , with text blasts to constituents and posters posted within polling precincts , insinuating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [ Communist Party of the Philippines and allies ] .\\n” Social media disinformation Explaining the polling in the face of a massive social media disinformation campaign by Marcos supporters , Rappler ’ s livestream anchor Bea Cupin noted how the Duterte administration had denied a renewal of a franchise for ABS-CBN , the largest and most influential free-to-air television station two years ago .\\nThis act denied millions of Filipinos access to accurate and unbiased news coverage .\\nRappler itself and its Nobel Peace laureate chief executive Maria Ressa , were also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of social media trolls .\\nA BBC report interviewed a typical professional troll who managed hundreds of Facebook pages and fake profiles for his clients , saying his customers for fake stories “ included governors , congressmen and mayors.\\n” Meta — owners of Facebook — reported that its Philippines subsidiary had removed many networks that were attempting to manipulate people and media .\\nThey were believed to have included a cluster of more than 400 accounts , pages , and groups that were violated the platform ’ s codes of conduct .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robredo , who defeated Marcos for the vice-presidency in the last election in 2016 , and who was a target for many of the troll attacks , said : “ Lies repeated again and again become the truth.\\n” Academics have warned the risks that the country is taking in not heeding warnings of the past about the Marcos family .\\nAn associate professor of the University of Philippines , Dr Aries Arugay , reflects : “ We just don ’ t jail our politicians or make them accountable … we don ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presidents.\\n” As Winston Churchill famously said in 1948 : “ Those that fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it .\\n”',\n",

       "  'content': 'CO-GOVERNANCE , and what it means for New Zealand , is predicted to feature prominently in next year ’ s general election .\\nPassions are already running high on both sides of this issue .\\nAll the more reason , one would think , for this country ’ s public broadcasters to facilitate a reasoned debate between those holding opposing views .\\nAlas , in 2022 , the publicly-owned radio network , RNZ , appears to have either forgotten how to conduct reasoned debate , or repudiated the whole idea .\\nOn the morning of Wednesday , 11 May 2022 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promoting her latest contribution to “ The Detail ” series of podcasts .\\nEntitled “ Co-Governance : Time To Get On With It ?\\n” , Bretkelly ’ s piece featured just two participants .\\nThese were Chris Finlayson , former National Party Minister for Treaty Settlements , and Traci Houpapa , Chair of the Federation of Māori Authorities , both of whom were , indisputably , well-qualified to speak on the podcast ’ s subject .\\nUnfortunately , they were also very strong supporters of co-governance .\\nBrettkelly had not thought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opinions of equally strong and well-qualified opponents of co-governance .\\nNow , there will be those who object immediately that “ balanced reporting ” does not require the arguments for and against any given proposition to be included in the same broadcast .\\nFor balance to be maintained , it is sufficient that the views of antagonists and protagonists are presented to the audience fairly , and with equal potential impact , within roughly the same timeframe .\\nSo long as Brettkelly , or some other RNZ Contract Producer , created a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of co-governance , all would be well .\\nSadly , given the current ideological climate in which RNZ ’ s journalists are required to operate , the chances of such a podcast being made are extremely slim .\\nTo broadcast such a production would be considered a breach of RNZ ’ s obligations under te Tiriti o Waitangi .\\nIt would also very likely be denounced by at least some of RNZ employees as a source of actual harm to their own and other New Zealanders ’ well-being .\\nAfter all , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less of an expert than Chris Finlayson himself , that only the “ Sour Right ” and other “ losers ” oppose co-governance .\\nWhat possible benefit could there be in providing a publicly-owned platform from which the views of people who “ don ’ t like tangata whenua ” and who “ dream of a world that never was and never could be ” , are spewed forth ?\\nAs the title of Brettkelly ’ s podcast suggests , the question is not whether or not co-governance represents a fundamental and unmandated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ norms ; or even whether it is a politically feasible objective ; but whether or not it is time to just get on with the job .\\nOr , to quote Finlayson , addressing those who might still be entertaining doubts : “ Go with the flow ” .\\nClearly , among the people Brettkelly and her ilk deem worthy of a RNZ platform , there is no debate about co-governance .\\nOr , at least , no debate in which representatives of iwi , or the Crown , should allow themselves to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s podcast , it becomes increasingly clear that “ The Crown ” is a player in the co-governance drama who merits much closer scrutiny .\\nMost of us , when we hear someone refer to The Crown , rather naively ( it turns out ) assume the term is being used to describe the Government – the body which we , as citizens of New Zealand , elect to manage the country on our behalf .\\nWhen iwi representatives and Cabinet ministers talk about The Crown they have something else in mind altogether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represents permanent and supreme executive power .\\nIt encompasses all the decisive institutions of the New Zealand state : the Executive Council ( a.k.a the Cabinet ) ; the senior echelons of the public service ; the armed forces and the Police ; the national security apparatus ; and – most important of all – the Judiciary .\\nWhy is this important ?\\nBecause the Treaty of Waitangi was presented to the representatives of the indigenous people of these islands by a representative of the British Crown .\\nIt was a take-it-or-leave-it deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not by the British people , who , in 1840 , had bugger-all say in the treaties negotiated by their betters ( and still don ’ t ) but by agents of the British state .\\nMāori took the deal precisely because , at that time , the British state was the most powerful executive authority on Earth .\\nWhat undermined the Treaty was the steady devolution of authority from the executive power back in London , and from its local representative , the Governor ( kawanatanga ) to the representative institutions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown from a couple of thousand to something equal to or greater than the indigenous population .\\nIn the eyes of these settler governments , the Treaty was not an agreement in which they had played any part , and most certainly was not a document they had the slightest intention of honouring .\\nIn the early 1860s , they demanded from London – and got – the overwhelming military force they required to extinguish the Treaty and , along with it , the very idea of co-governance .\\nThe re-birth of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the institutions of Pakeha representation , at least , not in the sense that the plan has been endorsed by a democratically-elected Parliament , and then ratified by the citizens of New Zealand in a democratic referendum .\\nIt is , rather , the work of Cabinet Ministers and Judges ; of the New Zealand executive which has slowly emerged to replace the tutelary power and influence of the British state .\\nThe force that now calls itself “ The Crown ” .\\nThis is what lies behind the tangata whenua ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they prefer to call it , “ the tyranny of the majority ” , and their preference for working with The Crown alone .\\nThey understand perfectly what most Pakeha have yet to grasp : that representative democracy was the political instrument that secured their dispossession .\\nThey know that New Zealand can have democracy , or it can have co-governance , but it can ’ t have both .\\nFair enough .\\nBut how are the citizens of New Zealand to explain the scorn and disdain in which The Crown so clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Crown knows that the measures required to keep the peace between Māori and Pakeha will never receive the imprimatur of a freely and fairly elected New Zealand Parliament ?\\nThat only under a constitutional arrangement in which Iwi and The Crown between them wield sufficient power to over-rule the will of “ The ( Pakeha ) People ” can the instruments of peace be forged ?\\nIs it simply because Iwi and The Crown know that co-governance will never be forged by free and fair debate , but only by them “ @ @ @ @ @ @',\n",

       "  'content': 'I SURE HOPE Kelvin Davis wasn ’ t a history teacher before he became a principal and then Te Tai Tokerau ’ s MP .\\nWhy ?\\nBecause his grasp of what happened in this country between the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi and today isn ’ t just wrong , it also has the potential to create great mischief .\\nThe speech he delivered to the House of Representatives on Wednesday ( 11/5/22 ) is a particularly grim example of the Minister for Māori-Crown Relations historical ignorance .\\nIn it he appeared to equate the Opposition parties with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present .\\nThis was more than just racially inflammatory , it represents a dangerous distortion of reality .\\nAddressing the Opposition Benches , Davis declared : “ They conveniently overlook the fact that their wealth , their privilege and their authority was built off the backs of other people ’ s misery and entrenched inequality across generations.\\n” This is interesting .\\nNational ’ s leader , Christopher Luxon , was born in 1970 , and the Act leader , David Seymour , in 1983 .\\nAt the ages of 52 and 39 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them many generations across which to have inflicted misery and entrenched inequality !\\nHe would have been on slightly firmer ground if he had been addressing his remarks to Labour ’ s Roger Douglas – whose policies did indeed inflict misery and inequality .\\nPerhaps not across generations , but certainly since 1984 .\\nExcept , of course , Labour MPs don ’ t like to draw attention to those policies – mostly on account of the fact that their party has done so little over nearly 40 years to reverse them .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he described to the House the fate of his ancestors at the hands of Nineteenth Century colonial authorities .\\nThe gradual consolidation of the colonial state : its laws and regulations ; effectively dispossessed Davis ’ s forebears , leaving them destitute and demoralised .\\nWhat Davis failed to mention , however , is that the Nineteenth Century dispossession of the Māori was Crown policy .\\nMore importantly , it was a process cheered to the echo by the overwhelming majority of the burgeoning Pakeha population .\\nRich and poor alike understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the immiseration of the “ native ” population .\\nMeaning that it wasn ’ t just the ancestors of the present Opposition MPs who built their wealth and privilege off the backs of his tupuna , but also the present crop of Pakeha Labour MPs seated alongside him .\\nWhile it is certainly understandable that Davis was not anxious to castigate every Pakeha member of the House of Representatives for the crimes committed against his people by their ancestors ; crimes from which they continue , as a people , to draw enormous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhetoric at National and Act MPs exclusively was historically indefensible and morally obnoxious .\\nIf Davis is unaware that the single most devastating economic and social assault upon Māori of the last 50 years occurred on the Fourth Labour Government ’ s watch , then he has no business being an MP – let alone the Minister of Māori-Crown Relations .\\nCertainly he can not have forgotten that it was the Fifth Labour Government which oversaw the passage of the Seabed and Foreshore legislation .\\nOr , that it was a Labour Prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leading opponents of that legislation as “ haters and wreckers ” – preferring to meet with an excessively woolly ram than with the tangata whenua her proposed law had so outraged .\\nMaybe the reckless willingness of the Sixth Labour Government to embrace the co-governance agenda of its Māori caucus is a delayed reaction to the actions of the Fourth and the Fifth .\\nIf so , then it is a very foolish reaction .\\nHad Helen Clark and her Attorney-General not moved with speed to reverse the Court of Appeal ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled law , then Don Brash would , almost certainly , have won the 2005 General Election .\\nGiven that a National victory in 2005 would have meant the effective re-nullification of the Treaty and the abolition of the Māori Seats – provoking civil war – Māori and Pakeha both owe her a tremendous debt of gratitude .\\nThe depressing thing about the politics of the moment is the apparent historical amnesia of just about all its practitioners .\\nThe Settler Nation responsible for extinguishing the Treaty in the 1860s is simply not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zealand ’ s de facto constitution in the 2020s .\\nThe way Davis chose to deliver his thoughts to the House of Representatives : in the form of an attack on the Opposition ; shows just how impossible it is to construct an argument about our history that does not inevitably boil down to the equivalent of Sir Michael Cullen ’ s memorable taunt : “ We won .\\nYou lost .\\nEat that !\\n” The most frightening aspect of Davis ’ s performance is that it showed no signs that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of what will happen to that relationship if co-governance is forced upon an unwilling Pakeha nation .\\nDavis ’ s colleague , Willie Jackson , has labelled the Act leader a “ useless Māori ” and “ a dangerous man ” .\\nBut David Seymour is no more or less “ useless ” than those Māori iwi and hapu who saw which way the wind was blowing in the 1850s and 60s and ended up fighting alongside General Cameron ’ s imperial troops .\\nAs for being a dangerous man .\\nWell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be proven if Seymour and his party attract sufficient support to enforce the implementation of Act ’ s radical policies .\\nHe will be a dangerous man only because his fellow New Zealanders have made him one – by voting for him .\\nIt ’ s not Seymour that poses a danger to you and your people , Willie , it ’ s democracy .\\nBut , then , you already knew that , didn ’ t you ?\\nIt ’ s not the Opposition that has somehow cornered all the privilege , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property of the 70 percent of the New Zealand population known as Pakeha .\\nThese fair-skinned Polynesians are not – and never will be – “ Europeans ” .\\nJust as contemporary Māori are not – and never will be again – the Māori who inhabited these islands before colonisation .\\nBoth peoples are the victims of historical forces too vast for blame , too permanent for guilt .\\nIt is high time we stopped using History as a weapon , and started relying upon it as a guide .',\n",

)\\nAs we all know , something dramatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prior to Rogernomics , Budgets had been newsworthy largely because they were the occasion for rises in government taxes on petrol , tobacco and alcohol .\\nLess frequently they made news on account of minor adjustments to Income Tax .\\nRoger Douglas put paid to all of that .\\nAfter 1984 , Budgets became part of the grand theatre of economic reform .\\nNot even the “ Musts ” escaped the attention of the reformers .\\nThe National Party Finance Minister , Ruth Richardson , confronted with another day of fiscal reckoning in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Mother of All Budgets ” .\\n( A reference to Iraq dictator Saddam Hussein ’ s promised “ Mother of All Battles ” during the First Gulf War , which should have warned New Zealanders what Richardson had in store ! )\\nIt was TMOAB that slashed the incomes of beneficiaries by 25 percent – impoverishing thousands .\\nFor some Kiwis , Budgets were now events to be feared .\\nIn spite of the best efforts of the political marketing experts , there has not been a Budget to match Ruth Richardson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years .\\nYes , there have been years in which Bill English ( another National Finance Minister ) felt obliged to cut back sharply on what he memorably described as the “ Nice To Haves ” .\\n( Government projects that made life easier , happier , more fulfilling . )\\nBut the “ Musts ” have limped on from one Jerry-built Budget to the next .\\nThose dark clouds gathering on the horizon , however , speak gloomily of another day of reckoning that is fast approaching .\\nIt will not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24 hours will be climate change , global financial fragility , the weakening and breaking of supply chains , rising geopolitical tensions , rampant inflation , and the ongoing effects of a global pandemic .\\nTo keep the lights on and the ATMs working in the face of these challenges , governments all around the world have been forced to borrow and spend like there was no tomorrow .\\n( Which , with the hooves of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse thundering across the planet , may not be an unreasonable prediction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grant Robertson , has about as much chance of holding these grim arrivals at the border as King Canute had of keeping the incoming tide at bay .\\nThe budget Robertson delivered today , like most budgets , is a holding operation .\\nIf he ’ s lucky , in a final bid to retain control of the Treasury Benches , he will get the chance to borrow and spend all over again in 2023 .\\nIf , however , Robertson is unlucky and/or unsuccessful , then he is unlikely to be too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely relieved that he does not have to write the 2024 Budget .\\nAnd if his assumed successor , Nicola Willis , has a lick of sense she will persuade her boss , Christopher Luxon , to hand-off the job of dealing with the Mother of All Days of Reckoning to Act ’ s David Seymour .\\nAfter all , he ’ s the man with the machete .\\nRather than search for a Budget title to top Ruth Richardson ’ s , Seymour should dispense altogether with the hoopla and razzamatazz surrounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hopes to present will be nothing more – nor less – than an exercise in basic accountancy , that ’ s the description he should use .\\nThat the phrase ‘ an exercise in basic accountancy ’ will forever after strike fear into the hearts of New Zealanders is , sadly , as unavoidable as death and taxes .',\n",

ship , and two even bigger just built , should sail one way full and the other way empty is an entirely predictable consequence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the particular form of Capitalism which governs our lives !\\nIn the nineteen sixties , when Western Capitalism had exhausted every means of remaining profitable in its own market , it began moving its factories offshore in search of cheaper labour

.\\nVastly in debt to China , and with no viable cheap alternative , Western Capitalism is now owned by China .\\nAnd Western Capitalism ’ s only way out of the corner it finds itself in is to persuade its other “ partners in crime ” that China has somehow cheated on the deal , and that adjustments must be made to curb China ’ s authority .\\nWhich is why our Capitalist media has been feeding us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruthless China is .\\nWith Western Capitalism ’ s insatiable appetite for obscene profits having brought us to this perilous point , its strategy to save itself has been expanded to also include Russia , the other great power it has been unable to subdue , and which , consequently , we must also be taught to loath , hate and fear .\\nThe Same Old Stories Repeating the same tall tales that have always worked , the Capitalist media first describes the offending “ regime ” as a dictatorship and its leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there the stories move on to tales of cruelty to women and children , oppression of minorities , religious groups and the suppression of opposition political parties .\\nAnd then ultimately , once the shooting starts , a stage not yet reached with China but now enveloping Russia , we get fed stories of ruthless attacks on hospitals , schools , supermarkets , churches , and the destruction of vital public utilities , all topped off with bloody stories of the wanton killing of innocent individuals .\\nAnd no matter how many times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like weapons of mass destruction in Iraq , chemical weapons in Syria , babies thrown from incubators in Kuwait , still we swallow them , hook line and sinker .\\nIf the Media asked nicely it seems many would be prepared to proceed to gut and fillet themselves .\\nWith its plans for China simmering , Western Capitalism is proceeding first to destroy Russia .\\nBut , because Russia is a nuclear power , its employing proxies to do its dirty work .\\nIgnoring the fact that the USSR was dissolved in 1991 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Western Capitalism wants more .\\nAnd having been thwarted in its attempts to simply seize Russia , as it tried to do when the Soviet Union collapsed , Western Capitalism now plans to first destroy it economically , and then seize it .\\nAnd to do that Western Capitalism is using its control of Nato , whose membership it has expanded to include former USSR members states , which it is now employing to so threaten Russia ’ s security that Russia has to retaliate , and so we have the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made to become an integral part of the Capitalist family must be ignored .\\nAnd we certainly can ’ t mention that if it wasn ’ t for Russia ’ s great WW2 sacrifices , the fight against the Nazi tyranny would have been lost .\\nNor can we be reminded that China was fighting the Japanese ten years before Western Capitalism declared war on Japan , or that the US branch of Western Capitalism was still trading with the Nazis up until 1941 , by which time my father , and many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bastards .\\nAnd we certainly can ’ t mention that Ukraine collaborated with the invading Nazis in WW2 , colluding with them in the deaths of thousands ,

makes the case that its wars are justified for the “ democracy and freedom ” they bring .\\nAnd so we get people like former US Secretary of State , the vile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of half a million Iraqi children “ was worth it ” for all the good things the US invasion brought to their country .\\nWestern Capitalism , subduing all before it , is just another form of Imperialism .\\nAt the outset , when domestically-produced goods first started being made offshore , the Capitalist media , ignoring the plight of workers thrown on the scrap heap by the betrayal , instead trumpeted Capitalism ’ s move for providing consumers with more affordable goods , assuring us that any profits would trickle down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything would be rosie .\\nAnd ever since , official indicators that would normally expose the fallacy of those assurances have been gerrymandered to hide the terrible consequences suffered by working people .\\nFor instance people working part time or in temporary employment can be regarded as “ fully employed ” and so not numbered among the jobless .\\nThe rotten irony of Western Capitalism is that , for all its lauding of the virtues of free enterprise and the evils of Socialism , it is social spending ’ s greatest beneficiary .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ was suggested that last week ’ s budget payment of a cost of living subsidy to the poor would go straight to every supermarket ’ s bottom line , so too does every dollar paid to a beneficiary wind up in Capitalism ’ s pocket .\\nAnd since public works departments were dismantled , so too do all the huge sums allocated for building and maintaining infrastructure , hospitals , schools , public buildings , dams , housing , bridges and roading , end up in Capitalist coffers .\\nBut it gets worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of “ profits before people ” having brought us to the brink of war , requiring vast sums of public money to be budgeted for wars , again it ’ s Capitalism , which owns the arms industry , hat profits from it .\\nArmaments produced by the Military Industrial Complex are not constrained by price , or any competitive quoting system , but , so , long as the Capitalist media can create enough fear among enough people , weapons of war can be sold for whatever exorbitant price Western Capitalism cares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that situation is made ever more cruel by the fact that so many workers who were made redundant by Western Capitalism ’ s move to cheaper labour markets , are now employed in the arms industry .\\nWhere , in effect , they are paid from public funds to make profits for the system that destroyed their jobs , to make weapons intended to destroy the workers to whom those jobs were given .\\nOur arsenal is not as empty as those shipping containers If all this rings a bell but seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is something we can do !\\nWe can demand that our media be required to tell both sides of the story of any conflict , not just that supplied by those hired to supply stories that benefit Western Capitalism ’ s vested interests .\\nWe can demand that your government and media explain why , if China ’ s reported interests in the Pacific pose a threat to our security , why are Russia ’ s similar concerns about Nato forces being situated on its borders , not similarly valid .\\nWe you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported in Ukraine are so horrendous as to require us to adopt sanctions against Russia and to send military and civilian aid to the victims , why is similar action not taken against Israel for the creeping genocide it has been conducting on the Palestinians for the past 75 years .\\nWe can demand that those charged with ensuring that goods and services we consume meet the highest standards , be also required to scrutinise the media , whose biased content poses a greater threat to our health and safety than any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monitor .\\nAnd if the Media , or your MP , or Jacinda , or Luxon , or Mahuta won ’ t respond to these concerns , we can report them to the Ombudsman , or to any number of consumer watchdog organisations , including the Consumer Council , or even the broadcasting Standards Authority or the Press Council , although I wouldn ’ t bet on the last two doing much .\\nWe are only as powerless as we allow ourselves to be .',\n",

       "  'content': 'WHEN HENRY KISSINGER , at the age of 98 , feels impelled to weigh-in on the Russo-Ukrainian War , we should probably listen .\\nHe is , after all , the man who , as US Secretary of State from 1973-77 , played the game of geopolitics more adroitly than any of his successors in that office .\\nRuthless and amoral he may be , but his grasp of the art of international diplomacy is unsurpassed .\\nAnd now he is telling the world to bring the Russo-Ukrainian War to an end , right now , while we still can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warns , events may spiral beyond the capacity of any of the players to control them .\\nComing from the man who brought the world to the brink of a full-scale nuclear war in 1973 , this is sobering stuff .\\nWhat has got this nonagenarian so spooked ?\\nThe most probable answer is ‘ Oil ’ .\\nThis is something Kissinger knows a lot about .\\nIt was the United States ’ military support for Israel in the Yom Kippur War of October 1973 that prompted the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the price of oil , and which led the world ’ s largest oil exporter , Saudi Arabia , supported by its Arab allies , to place an embargo on the export of petroleum to the United States .\\nNo single action undertaken in the post-war era has had a greater impact on the fortunes of the West .\\nIt was President Richard Nixon ’ s decision , prompted by Kissinger , to move the United States nuclear strike force to “ Defcon 3 ” that persuaded the Soviet Union to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egypt and Syria .\\nWhen these failed to defeat the Israelis , it was the US Secretary of State ’ s “ shuttle diplomacy ” between the contending parties that secured the lasting cease-fire agreement of 25 October 1973 .\\nWhat Kissinger learned in 1973 was that it is absolutely imperative to bring any military conflict in which nuclear-armed nations are directly , or indirectly , involved to an end as swiftly as possible .\\nThe longer such a conflict lasts , the greater the chances that something will happen that brings the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct contact with one another – opening the way for an almost unstoppable escalation towards a full-scale nuclear exchange .\\nGuided by the United States , the members of Nato have so far restricted themselves to supplying the Ukrainians with defensive military equipment , making it clear to the Russian Federation that the Western alliance will not intervene directly in the conflict .\\nWhat has so clearly alarmed Kissinger , however , is the apparent lack of diplomatic urgency on the part of the United States to bring about a cessation of hostilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the concessions he would require from Ukraine to secure an enduring peace settlement .\\nEssentially , Kissinger ’ s peace plan calls for a restoration of the status quo ante – i.e .\\nRussia retains Crimea , Donets and Luhansk .\\nWith typical ruthlessness he advises the United States to use its strategic leverage with Ukraine to secure its compliance .\\nEver the “ realist ” , he understands that the war can only be ended by the USA and the Russian Federation .\\nThat the Biden Administration does not appear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war to drag on for three destructive months , is what has drawn him back into the international spotlight .\\nKissinger is also keenly aware of the impact soaring energy costs will have on the energy-poor nations of the West .\\nThe energy crisis sparked by the Yom Kippur War fundamentally deranged the post-war economic and social order , unleashing the destabilising combination of rising inflation and rising unemployment .\\nThe parallels with the present global situation will not have been lost on Kissinger .\\nNor will he be unmindful of the potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ s blockade of the Ukrainian port of Odessa .\\nUpwards of 400 million human-beings are dependent on Russia ’ s and Ukraine ’ s grain for their daily bread .\\nThe destabilising impact of an international energy crisis , coupled with an international food crisis , only reinforces his argument for hostilities to be ended with the utmost possible speed .\\nKissinger ’ s familiarity with the rulers of the Arab world will also be causing him to worry about their most likely response to American demands for a price-lowering increase in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Acutely sensitive to the price of gas at the American petrol pump , United States politicians are searching for ways to compel the major oil exporters to bow to their demands – on pain of having their American assets seized .\\nKissinger ’ s intimate knowledge of the way the world ’ s wealthiest states conduct their business affairs will have alerted him to the extreme danger of such threats .\\nLooking at the steady decline in the fortunes of Wall Street over recent days , he may well detect the orderly exit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nIt certainly makes no sense for the Oil Lords to leave assets in place for the American Government to seize .\\nBut , if the Saudis and their allies are quietly cashing-up , it raises immediately the all-important question of where they should put their newly liquidated wealth .\\nThere are only a handful of serious candidates for such large scale investment : China , Russia and India .\\nSuch a destabilising shift in the weight of the financial world would alter the balance of the global economy as fundamentally as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than anyone , Kissinger understands the precariousness of global strategic position .\\nIf OPEC pivots away from the USA and towards the Eurasian powers , then Russia ’ s prosecution of the war in Ukraine can be extended more-or-less indefinitely .\\nCertainly , OPEC ’ s cash will allow President Vladimir Putin to snap his fingers at US and EU sanctions .\\nThe Russo-Ukrainian War will become a simple test to see which combination of forces can hold out the longest – the East ’ s or the West ’ s ?\\nBled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the price of bread , butter , cooking oil and meat soaring beyond the reach of all but the wealthiest consumers , the economies of the West will begin to scream .\\n( Just as Chile ’ s economy screamed when Kissinger caused it to be squeezed in the months leading up to the US-backed military coup against its socialist government in September 1973 . )\\nThe joyous Western unity , inspired by Ukraine ’ s fearless resistance to the invading Russian army , will begin to fray .\\nNato will fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is never safe for any power to bet the farm on Russia collapsing first .\\nWhen it comes to enduring suffering , the Russians have few equals .\\nSecretary Kissinger knows this , even if President Joe Biden does not .\\nTime to give peace a chance – before somebody does something rash .',\n",

or the Russian blockade of Odesa , Ukraine ’ s wheat exporting port on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Chinese supply-chains due to Omicron ; or the ever more serious effects of Climate Change .\\nNo .\\nWhen it comes to deciding who to vote for , Kiwis ’ preferences will be driven by factors that have very little to do with Prebble ’ s dialectical-materialism .\\nWatching Jacinda Ardern ’ s performance on Stephen Colbert ’ s Late Show , I was struck by just how extraordinarily good she can be when the wind is in her sails .\\nWhile there ’ s no disputing that her confidence took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to living with the Coronavirus , and that a downcast Jacinda Ardern is no bloody fun at all , there ’ s equally no disputing the fact that , as we have seen , even prime minister ’ s moods can be changed .\\nWhat may not be all that easy to change , however , is the growing perception that Christopher Luxon is just another tory boofhead , and that his National Party has long since crossed the line separating rational conservatism from the same sort of boofheadism that brought down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joyce .\\nI mean Simeon Brown ?\\nMark Mitchell ?\\nAre we really supposed to take these characters seriously ?\\nAnd while we ’ re on the subject of ineptitude , who the hell was it who talked-up Nicola Willis as some sort of economic whizz-kid ?\\nHer recent performances as National ’ s shadow finance minister have been woeful .\\nPitted against Grant Robertson , she risks being exposed as just another empty National vessel .\\nSimilarly , I have no doubt that when the election debates roll around next year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nProviding she holds onto that poise and confidence she displayed on the Late Show , she has every chance of demonstrating to New Zealanders the foolishness of changing political horses in midstream .\\nShe ’ ll need something to say , of course .\\nSomething over and above simply sounding like a credible and competent prime minister .\\nThinking about it , that ’ s what made her time on the Late Show so productive .\\nShe had something positive and progressive – gun reform – to hold up to an American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocents .\\nSomething that the Republicans she didn ’ t name , but who were clearly in her mind , could never hope to match .\\nThe most effective “ over and above ” policy constellation , IMHO , would be a bold and unapologetic pledge to reform the way the New Zealand state operates .\\nIf Jacinda Ardern and her ministers were to explain how ineffective the state has become under the administrative protocols of the past thirty-five years – offering up its pitiful outputs on health , education , housing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence – her government ’ s collective failure to deliver would , at least , be explained .\\nBlend into that narrative the need to improve the delivery of services to Māori and Pasifika , and then top it off with a promise to comprehensively rejig our electoral laws .\\nThat would give the PM plenty to talk about : plenty of opportunities to display her hallmark idealism and empathy Of course Prebs would dismiss all this with a derisory snort .\\nConstitutional reform butters no parsnips , he ’ d say – @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 500gms !\\nExcept , a halfway competent Finance Minister would explain that if Anchor butter ’ s at that price it ’ s only because Fonterra and our dairy farmers are creaming it on the international market – and that ’ s a good thing , isn ’ t it ?\\nWhat voters want more than anything else is the sense that an incumbent government continues to be a work-in-progress : that it ’ s still got plenty of things it wants to do before its through – changes that promise to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Voters want to know that their leaders aren ’ t just thinking about them : they want to know that they are thinking , full stop .\\nIn sharp contrast to American voters , the electors of Australia and New Zealand still possess fully operational crap detectors .\\nThey will not vote for boofheads – or , at least , not indefinitely .',\n",

of , and awarding of contracts to , Mahuta ’ s whanau in circumstances that , at the very least , raise serious questions about this Government ’ s political judgement .\\nEnlarging this narrative is the growing public perception that the mainstream news media is refusing to cover a story that would , in other circumstances , have attracted intense journalistic interest .\\nThe conflation of these two , highly damaging narratives with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” – has left the Labour Government in an extremely exposed and vulnerable position .\\nThe Government ’ s failure to adequately prepare the New Zealand public for what Labour clearly regards as the inevitability of co-governance hasn ’ t helped .\\nThe party did not campaign on the issue , and kept He Puapua , the controversial “ road-map ” to full implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples – i.e .\\nco-governance – by 2040 , under wraps .\\nSimilarly unheralded was the Government ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Authority .\\nAnd the application of co-governance principles to Mahuta ’ s deeply unpopular “ Three Waters ” project has done nothing to allay public fears that the country is being changed , in fundamental ways , without the electorate ’ s consent .\\nThe apparent failure of the mainstream news media to follow up on the story is being attributed to the extraordinary conditions attached to the Public Interest Journalism Fund administered by New Zealand On Air .\\nIn essence , these conditions require media outlets in receipt of the Fund ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a highly contentious series of propositions concerning the Treaty of Waitangi – most particularly to the Waitangi Tribunal ’ s claim the Māori never ceded sovereignty to the British Crown , and that this “ fact ” requires the Fund ’ s recipients to accept and support the “ partnership ” model of Crown-Māori relations .\\nThe fear expressed by independent journalists is that the net effect of these conditions will be unquestioning mainstream media support for co-governance .\\nSince the widespread assumption among Pakeha New Zealanders is that co-governance and representative democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willingness to be presented as co-governance ’ s friend runs the risk of being cast as democracy ’ s enemy .\\nOf even greater concern is the inevitability of this anti-democratic characterisation being extended to an ever-increasing fraction of the Māori population .\\nStatements from Māori leaders appearing to discount the importance of , or even disparage , the principles of democracy have done little to slow this process .\\nNeither have the intemperate statements of the former National Party Minister for Treaty Settlements , Chris Finlayson .\\nHis comment to the online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-governance as “ the KKK brigade ” , merely reinforces the widespread public perception that the slightest public opposition to the proposed changes will bring down accusations of racism upon the opponent ’ s head .\\nThe problem with this willingness to indulge in ad hominem attacks on people holding genuine reservations about the Government ’ s proposals is that more and more of them will decide that they might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb , and embrace the very racism of which they stand accused .\\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of a Māori Minister of the Crown ’ s whanau have been the recipients of Government funds , and appointed to roles not unrelated to the furtherance of the Minister ’ s policies , will be taken as confirmation that all is not as it should be in Aotearoa-New Zealand .\\nWhat began as an anti-co-governance narrative , and then merged with an anti-mainstream news media narrative , risks joining with a much older and more deeply entrenched narrative concerning the entire Treaty settlement process .\\nThis is the narrative that identifies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a collection of Crown-assembled tribal elites , along with their legal and commercial advisers .\\nOver the past thirty years these “ Neo-Tribal Capitalists ” have been accused of investing hundreds-of-millions of taxpayer dollars in what amount to private tribal corporations , over which the intended recipients of these funds – hapu and whanau – exercise only the most indirect authority and receive only the most meagre of rewards .\\nThe result could very easily be the emergence of what might be called a “ super-narrative ” in which all the negatives of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capitalism are rolled into one big story about the deliberate corruption of New Zealand democracy .\\nThe guilty parties would be an unholy alliance of Pakeha and Māori elites determined to keep public money flowing upwards into protected private hands .\\nIn this super-narrative , the structures set forth in He Puapua to secure tino rangatiratanga , will actually ensure the exclusion of the vast majority of New Zealanders from the key locations of power .\\nThe only positive consequence of which will be a common struggle for political and economic equality in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every incentive to involve themselves .\\nThe painful irony of this super-narrative scenario is that Labour will have positioned itself as its cause – not its remedy .\\nRather than repeating in the Twenty-First Century the fruitful political alliance between the Pakeha working-class and the victims/survivors of the deals done between the Crown and the Māori aristocracy in the Nineteenth and Twentieth , Labour will be seen to have facilitated the creation of a Treaty Partnership that not only undermines democracy , but also exacerbates the inequality between Māori and Pakeha , Pakeha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What lies ahead , as the institutions of co-governance take shape , is the coming together of two very privileged birds of a feather : the Pakeha professionals and managers who have taken command of the society and economy created by Neoliberalism , and the Māori professionals and managers created to produce and operate the cultural and economic machinery of Neo-Tribal Capitalism .\\nThis , ultimately , will be the spectre that arises out of the controversy swirling around Nanaia Mahuta .\\nThe spectre of the worst of both the Pakeha and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful trample all over the weak .\\nWhere tradition constrains the free exploration of ideas and techniques .\\nAnd where the petty advantages of separation are elevated above the liberating effects of unity .\\nWhere “ Aotearoa ” creates two peoples out of one .',\n",

       "  'content': 'STAN RODGER , Minister of Labour , and Minister of State Services in the Fourth Labour Government , died on Sunday , 29 May 2022 , aged 82 .\\nBetween 1978 and 1986 , Stan was my Member of Parliament .\\nIn 1984 , that crucial year which saw the fall of Robert Muldoon and his right-wing populist National Government , I found myself on Stan ’ s campaign team for the Dunedin North Labour Electorate Committee .\\nThe Labour Party of 1984 was a monstrous creature .\\nIt ’ s branch membership , alone , was close to 100,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affiliated to the party .\\nIt also possessed a large and highly vocal left-wing : people who took the Party ’ s pledge to promote the cause of “ democratic socialism ” seriously .\\nOne morning , early in 1984 , three old comrades from the student protest movements of the 1970s chanced to run into one another in the student union cafeteria at the University of Otago .\\nTo our considerable consternation , we discovered that all three of us were working on the campaign committees of Labour MPs and candidates .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretentions of Labour claimants to that title , now found themselves designing pamphlets , organising photo-shoots , and analysing canvassing returns .\\n“ Has it truly come to this ?\\n” We asked ourselves .\\n“ Have we all become fucking social-democrats !\\n” Within days of that embarrassing reunion , I had put a new set of words to the tune of Cliff Richard ’ s 1963 hit “ We ’ re All Going On A Summer Holiday ” .\\nNo more Trotsky , no more Lenin or Mao .\\nI ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us now !\\nStan Rodger had a pretty good feel for the political leanings of the people he worked with .\\nCertainly , he could recognise the many and various shades of red radicalism with relative ease .\\nI was not the only “ democratic socialist ” on his campaign committee , although it is fair to say that we were easily outnumbered by the Labour moderates among whom Stan felt most comfortable .\\nWhat distinguished him from practically every other member of the Labour caucus at that time , however , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political “ soul ” , the party needed to encompass the full range of democratic left-wing opinion .\\nIn the hierarchy of Labour ’ s “ broad church ” , that made Stan an Archbishop – at the very least !\\nBefore his death , Stan Rodger allowed himself to be interviewed by the veteran political journalist , Richard Harman .\\nIn the course of that interview , Stan revealed something very few people outside the upper echelons of the trade union movement of the 1960s – and the Security Intelligence Service – @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the secret because he was a rising star in the Public Service Association ( of which he would eventually become president ) as well as being a senior bureaucrat in the Ministry of Works .\\nAccording to Harman , as Stan started moving up the ranks of the PSA he encountered a highly organised underground movement within the PSA intended to advance the ideology and clout of the far-left .\\n“ Stan might have been a member of a political party that was still nominally socialist , ” writes Harman on his Politik @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , “ but like most Labour Party members , he subscribed to Michael Joseph Savage ’ s argument that the party ’ s philosophy was actually ‘ applied Christianity ’ .\\nStan , said Harman , “ had no time for pure socialism or Marxism.\\n” But , Marxists there were in the public service : “ a new cohort of university graduates with far-left views was making itself felt in Wellington.\\n” According to Stan , the wartime Labour Government of Peter Fraser had placed many of these young firebrands in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .\\nNow , as any good Kiwi leftist knows , the Department of Trade and Industry ( as the DIC was renamed ) came to be headed-up by New Zealand ’ s most effective left-wing intellectual , William ( Bill ) Sutch – the man who , in 1974 , was charged with espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union – and acquitted .\\nStan ’ s principal antagonist , however , wasn ’ t Sutch , but John P Lewin .\\nLewin , a former President of the PSA , senior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimately , Government Statistician , was the man who , according to Stan , became the unofficial leader of a far-left group within the PSA , calling itself the Korero Group .\\n“ It had many key activists in the PSA within it , ” Stan told Harman , “ with Lewin driving it out of the Trade and Industry department .\\nAnd Jim Turner , the last member that I knew that was in it , told me it always ran with huge discipline and would even expel people out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at arm ’ s length through the executive.\\n” What Stan Rodger has held back until he was safely beyond the reach of controversy are the bones of an explanation for one of the most devastating hit-jobs in the history of New Zealand political journalism .\\nThe exposé was published in the right-wing weekly newspaper , Truth , in July 1975 , and it purported to expose a “ plot ” to socialise much of the New Zealand economy which had been hatched on behalf of Labour Prime Minister , Norman Kirk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brien , Bill Sutch and Jack Lewin .\\nDismissed by Labour supporters at the time as just one more example of an increasingly sinister series of leaks and rumours ( what we would , today , call “ fake news ” ) intended to disorient and dismay the electorate in the run-up to the 1975 general election , Truth ’ s “ Plot ” may have been something else altogether .\\nIf Stan Rodger knew about the Korero Group , so , almost certainly , did the SIS .\\nUnable to prevent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the government department at the cutting edge of economic policy , the Security Services likely became increasingly fixated on the extent to which the “ far-left ” bureaucrats at Trade and Industry were influencing the direction of New Zealand economic development .\\nIt is possible , therefore , that right through the 1960s , and into the 1970s , there was a race between the Left and the Right to find a group of politicians with the courage to undertake a drastic reform of the New Zealand economy .\\nThe persecution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” about a plot to socialise the New Zealand economy ( almost certainly leaked to Truth by the SIS ) both bear testimony to the “ Deep State ’ s ” fear that the “ hugely disciplined ” left-wing “ cell ” in Trade and Industry had already found , or was about to find , the group it was looking for .\\nAs the man who made certain that David Lange entered Parliament , Stan Rodger , set in motion the political sequence of events that culminated , ironically , in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time concentrated in the Treasury – finding the group of politicians it had been looking for .\\nThe politicians who were to give us “ Rogernomics ” .\\nWith Stan Rodger ’ s passing it is no longer possible to ask him if he saw the rise and rise of the neoliberal “ cell ” at Treasury as clearly as he saw the defusing and dispersal of the Trade and Industry Marxists and the Korero Group .\\nI wonder if he would have agreed that there was a moment , at some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when New Zealand could have gone in an entirely different direction .',\n",

another billion-dollars-worth of state-of-the-art artillery to Kiev has been met with fury in Moscow .\\nThe rage of Putin and his mouthpieces is understandable .\\nWashington is giving the Ukrainians the weapons they need to keep the devastating Russian self-propelled guns out of range of the Donbass cities Moscow must take to secure anything remotely resembling victory .\\nWhat do the Americans know about Russia ’ s present military situation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s wrath in this way ?\\nThe Russian President has warned the United States and its Nato allies repeatedly that the supply of weapons capable of fundamentally altering the strategic balance of its “ Special Military Operation ” in Ukraine will produce unimaginable consequences .\\nBy this , Putin is clearly alluding to the Russian Federation ’ s nuclear capability .\\n“ Give Ukraine too much help , ” he is saying , “ and I ’ ll use my nukes.\\n” To find out why Biden and his Defence and National Security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ s bluff , we have to go all the way back to January and February of this year .\\nFrom the wealth of detail relating to Russia ’ s offensive plans for Ukraine – subsequently borne out by the facts of the Russian invasion – it is clear that there had been a massive breach of Russian military security .\\nSomehow , the Americans were reading Russia ’ s political and military leaders ’ mail .\\nObviously Putin , himself a counter-intelligence specialist , took steps to close up the breach .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ hierarchy started blipping off Russian screens .\\nIt is highly doubtful that the Americans would feel confident enough to call Putin ’ s nuclear bluff if they did not have it on very good authority , from those in a position to do so , that any move toward the tactical or strategic use of nuclear weapons by the Russian President will result in his immediate deposition .\\nThis could mean something thoroughly cinematic – like a patriotic bodyguard drawing his pistol , shooting Putin and his advisers dead , crying “ Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weapon on himself .\\nAlternatively , it could involve the commanders of Russia ’ s Strategic Rocket Forces sending an H-Bomb tipped missile hurtling into Putin ’ s supposedly blast-proof nuclear bunker .\\n( Spoiler Alert : There ’ s no such thing . )\\nOr , it could amount to senior officers in the know quietly communicating Putin ’ s location to the Americans in sufficient time for them to carry out the deposition themselves .\\nCertainly , there can be little doubt in the minds of senior Russian commanders that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are at any given moment of the day or night .\\nThe sheer number of Russian commanders killed by sniper-fire or drone-strikes since 24 February makes that terrifyingly clear .\\nThey will also know that if Putin is insane enough to actually order a tactical nuclear strike , the American response will be a massive , decapitating , counter-strike that will leave Russia leaderless and rudderless .\\nPrecisely because Russian nuclear-war-fighting doctrine devolves launch authority , in extremis , to battlefield commanders , the Americans will make damn sure that there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the context of this discussion it is important to remember that when the world was literally on the brink of Nuclear Armageddon in October 1962 , it was the good sense and humanitarian instincts of the political commissar aboard a Soviet nuclear-armed submarine under attack from US Navy-launched depth-charges , off Cuba , who persuaded the vessel ’ s commanders not to respond with its nuclear torpedoes .\\nBy refusing to put his key in the unlocking mechanism , he saved himself , the crew , and the whole world from nuclear annihilation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose that Russian patriots have become so extreme that , rather than depose a delusional and potentially genocidal president , they would see the whole of Mother Russia – along with the rest of the planet – reduced to a radioactive ash-heap .\\nNor is it fanciful to suppose that Russia ’ s most intelligent and capable citizens have not long since realised that their country has no viable future as an independent nation if it persists in the folly of attempting to “ Make Russia Great Again ” by force of arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are : How many of those intelligent and capable citizens are there in the upper echelons of the Russian armed forces ?\\nAnd : How many of them have a working back-channel to the US Joint Chiefs of Staff ?\\nThe point of maximum danger will come if/when a day arrives when the Russian forces in Ukraine lose all offensive capability and begin to fall back under Ukrainian pressure .\\nThat moment is likely to come when the state-of-the-art weaponry currently being dispatched from the United States is effectively deployed on the battlefields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shut down the massive artillery barrages Russian military commanders rely upon to take their objectives .\\nIn the hugely popular television series , Game of Thrones , the stark warning that “ Winter is coming ” struck fear into the hearts of all the peoples of Westeros .\\nAlong the bitterly contested battle-lines of the Russo-Ukrainian War , the warning that should strike fear into the Russians ’ hearts is the seasonal opposite of the Game of Thrones .\\nNot the bitter snows of winter , but the sun-hardened fields of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Yellow Walkers can move with deadly speed .',\n",

       "  'content': 'THE GROWING CHORUS calling for Poto Williams to be sacked as Police Minister bespeaks a fundamental misreading of her performance .\\nWe are so used to bumptious males like Stuart Nash and Mark Mitchell holding ( or seeking ) this portfolio , that we read Williams ’ “ softly , softly ” approach as a sure-fire indication of failure .\\nBut , since when did inflated male chests , bombastic claims and political humbug ever bring about anything more useful than inflated poll-ratings ?\\nSince we have seen this noisy “ Laura Norder ” pantomime repeated over and over again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it makes next to no impact on crime .\\nMy impression of Williams is that she has spent the last 18 months searching desperately through all the available research/data for something that just might help her make a real difference .\\nBut , seeking to base government policy on something more substantial than rabid right-wing reckons is the very last thing an ambitious Police Minister should be doing .\\nThe tried and true methodology is to get the voters ’ blood up with rhetoric red in tooth and claw .\\nThen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task your officials with finding out what rabid right-wing police ministers overseas have settled upon as their solution to rising crime – and steal it .\\nChances are that the real-world effects of these “ solutions ” will be pretty close to zero .\\nBut , since the research/data only proves their ineffectuality after a two-to-five year time-lag , this is of no political consequence .\\nThe voters have already watched the launch of the Government ’ s getting tough on crime initiatives on the six o ’ clock news , dutifully bumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of percentage points , and then forgotten all about it – until the next crime wave .\\nIn response to which the entire pantomime will be re-staged .\\nSame script , different actors .\\nWhat most people simply don ’ t understand is how sophisticated criminal offending has become .\\nThey see the burly gang members , decked out in their patches , sitting astride their deafening motorcycles , cruising six abreast down the motorway as frightened civilians scramble to get out of their way , and they think these guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these guys represent little more than the misdirection of the criminal magicians no one ever gets to see .\\nWhile rival gangs are shooting up each other ’ s neighbourhoods , draining-off Police resources and thoroughly terrifying the public , core criminal business continues to be conducted largely unmolested .\\nThe Guardian of 7 June reports the existence , in Australia , of “ thousands ” of members of the Italian Mafia , or , more specifically , the ‘ Ndrangheta of Calabria .\\n( That ’ s the “ toe ” of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in plain sight in ordinary suburban communities , looking like any other Aussie , upwards of 5,000 of these criminals have been quietly plying their illegal trade for decades .\\nAccording to the Australian Associated Press : “ The Calabrian mafia work with other organised crime groups including bikie gangs and Asian or Middle Eastern crime groups to cooperate on drug importation , money laundering and violence.\\n” “ It ’ s entirely possible that people will be living next door to members of the ‘ Ndrangheta without knowing , ” the Assistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nigel Ryan , informed the media .\\n“ They ’ ve been able to stay under the radar while living modest lives in modest homes .\\nThey funnelled the illegitimate wealth into their legitimate construction , agricultural and catering businesses .\\nIn many ways , I would say that the ‘ Ndrangheta are actually the ones pulling the strings of other organised crime groups , particularly the more violent groups , such as outlaw motorcycle gangs.\\n” As The Daily Blog ’ s Editor , Martyn Bradbury , has been telling his readers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harsh immigration regime is sending hundreds of New Zealand-born members or associates of these same violent outlaw motorcycle gangs across the Tasman as deportees .\\nThese “ 501s ” have fundamentally changed the way New Zealand gangs do business , introducing a level of violence that had not hitherto been a feature of indigenous gang culture .\\nIt would be naïve in the extreme to assume that at least some of the ‘ Ndrangheta ’ s string-pullers had not crossed the Tasman with them .\\nThe Aussies run our largest banks , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( If you ’ ll pardon the tautology ! )\\nThe same Guardian article also makes reference to the extraordinary law enforcement coup that saw organised criminals around the world avail themselves of a supposedly unbreakable encryption app called “ ANoM ” .\\nLittle did the crooks know that their every text , every e-mail , every JPEG was being copied to the international law-enforcement inventors of ANoM .\\n“ Officers gathered intelligence from the ANoM app to understand how transnational serious organised crime syndicates – including the ‘ Ndrangheta – operate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ‘ Ndrangheta ?\\nAccording to Assistant Commissioner Ryan , Calabria ’ s organised criminals are “ responsible for 70 to 80 % of the world ’ s cocaine and they are flooding Australia with illicit drugs …..\\nThey are pulling the strings of Australian outlaw motorcycle gangs who are behind some of the most significant violence in our communities.\\n” Ultimately , it is the sort of intelligence gathering exemplified by ANoM that will provide the Police with the information they need to push back against the criminal organisations already well-ensconced in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Police Commissioner , Andrew Coster , is not working closely with Police Minister Poto Williams on this method of bringing not only the local gangs , but also , their Calabrian , Columbian , Mexican , Chinese and Australian string-pullers into New Zealand courtrooms , then he bloody well should be !\\nUndercover operatives and state-of-the-art electronic surveillance have been critical to the apprehension of organised criminals since the 1980s .\\n“ Eyes of Mordor ” they might have been , but they brought down the Five Families .\\nChristopher Luxon and Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibility that the recent spate of drive-by shootings may actually be intended to divert Police resources away from the string-pullers .\\nIn calling for Poto Williams ’ head , they may be doing the very thing that would most assist the real criminal masterminds .\\nIf this is the case , then a sudden reduction in drive-by shootings will not be a sign of Police success , but proof that the wise-guys are once again conducting their criminal enterprises in the preferred manner .',\n",

       "  'content': 'CONVENTIONAL ECONOMIC WISDOM insists that the only effective cure for rising inflationary expectations is a short , sharp recession .\\nEasy to say , but much , much harder to accomplish – especially if you are at least nominally a party of the Left .\\nThe ghost of John Maynard Keynes is forever whispering in the ears of Labour parties – even those which long ago embraced the precepts of Neoliberalism – and his message is always the same : Spend , spend , spend .\\nThe problem with spending in an inflationary environment is that it does nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic items in six months ’ time will be appreciably higher than they are now .\\nIn such circumstances , simple logic dictates that it is better to make a substantial purchase today , than tomorrow .\\nThey also encourage the idee fixe that one ’ s income must be increased to match , at the very least , the rate of inflation .\\nUnderstanding this expectation , employers budget to recover the cost of increased wages and salaries by increasing the price of their goods and services .\\nOnce stimulated , inflationary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wages and prices they set in motion , are very difficult to supress .\\nEssentially , a government is required to make it a lot more expensive for people to borrow money .\\nAt the macro level , sharply rising interest rates have the effect of slowing economic growth .\\nAt the micro level , employers stop hiring and start firing .\\nThose forced onto the dole face a dramatic loss of income and all discretionary spending ceases abruptly .\\nThe rest of the workforce , fearful of losing their jobs , stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also stop spending on non-essentials and start saving .\\nRetailers now have the strongest of incentives to keep their prices stable .\\nPretty soon , economic growth stalls , and then shifts into reverse .\\nPessimism reigns supreme .\\nInflationary expectations , along with inflation itself , comes to a shuddering halt .\\nThe trick , of course , is in knowing how long to keep the interest rates going up , when to hold them steady , and when to let them drop .\\nKeep them high for too long and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nThose with money , ill disposed to risk it , satisfy themselves with government-guaranteed returns .\\nUnable to borrow , or meet their higher interest payments , businesspeople go bust , and property-owners with mortgages lose their homes .\\nUnemployment rises , spending decreases still further , and retailers are forced to contemplate lowering their prices .\\nWhat the economists most fear now is not of inflation but deflation .\\nThe prospect of the economy simply grinding to a halt .\\nAt this point , all eyes turn to the government .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ also suffer in recessions and depressions – just like their citizens .\\nSlowing economic activity means fewer companies making profits , fewer people in paid employment , fewer dollars being spent , and much less revenue being collected .\\nWith its own “ income ” shrinking , the instinct of most government ’ s is to sharply reduce spending .\\nNow it is the turn of those businesses , organisations and institutions dependent on government money to feel the pinch .\\nExactly the same contractionary spiral that wound down the private sector , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nBut the trials and tribulations of the state do not stop there .\\nThe huge number of unemployed and otherwise impoverished people have nowhere else to turn for assistance but their government .\\nMeeting that need from a dwindling treasury , however , is the stuff of political nightmares .\\nJust keeping the education , health and transportation systems functioning is a huge drain on the state ’ s resources , feeding and housing the hungry and homeless threatens to render it insolvent .\\nBut you can ’ t just let people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the homeless themselves are likely to answer that question , as they did in New Zealand ’ s hungry winter of 1932 , when riots tore the main streets of Auckland , Wellington and Dunedin apart .\\nTerrified , the conservative coalition government postponed the 1934 general election by 12 months and passed the draconian Public Safety Conservation Act .\\nNot that it did them much good .\\nOn Tuesday , 26 November 1935 , New Zealanders elected their first Labour Government .\\nAnd what did that government do ?\\nIt spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what should Jacinda and Grant do ?\\nContinue to spend , spend , spend ?\\nOr allow Reserve bank Governor , Adrian Orr , to push up the Official Cash Rate ( OCR ) to 5 percent and watch economic activity nosedive ?\\nFrom a left-social-democratic perspective , at least part of the answer would be to embark on a massive political education campaign .\\nExplain to Labour ’ s voters the havoc inflation wreaks upon the lives of ordinary people , and why it must be driven out of the New Zealand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will require the full co-operation of the whole population .\\nThen announce a two-year wage , price and rent freeze .\\nFurther announce the state subsidisation of basic foodstuffs and energy supplies , to be paid for by higher taxes on the wealthy , the restoration of Death Duties and a Capital Gains Tax .\\nA return to the bad old days of Muldoonism ?\\nDamn straight !\\nIt certainly beats asking the poorest and most vulnerable New Zealanders to carry the full burden of eliminating inflation .\\nFew people appreciate that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was simply an eccentric form of Keynesianism – was to free the wealthy from their obligation to contribute their fair share towards the maintenance of a decent society .\\nThat was all Rogernomics and Ruthanasia were ever about : making the poor pay more so the rich didn ’ t have to .\\nNot that Jacinda and Grant are at all likely to adopt a left-social-democratic economic agenda to deal with the impending crisis .\\nThey will make the poor pay , pretend they ’ re not , fool nobody , and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ironically , their policy choices may end up decisively reducing inflationary expectations .\\nTo the limited degree permitted by Neoliberal economics , the economy will recover , and the National Party will kick-off another nine year term on a thoroughly sunny note .\\nWho knows , by the time the next election rolls around in 2026 they might even be in the mood to : Spend , spend , spend .',\n",

       "  'content': 'A detailed study of the killing of journalists released this week shows that Israel leads the world in this grimmest of statistics : Apartheid Israel tops the ranking by “ average number of journalists killed per 10 million of population per year ” that yields the following order : Occupied Palestine , over 6.164 ; Syria , 4.733 ; Afghanistan , 2.563 ; Israel-Palestine , over 2.190 ; Somalia , 1.751 ; Yemen , 1.278 ; Iraq , 0.897 ; Mexico , 0.750 ; Colombia , 0.366 ; Philippines , 0.283 ; Pakistan , 0.152 ; World , 0.084 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capita basis , the killing of journalists by Apartheid Israel in Occupied Palestine leads the World , and is 73.4 times greater than for the World as a whole .\\nIn contrast , India scores 3.1 times lower than the World .\\nThe present data shows that Apartheid Israel leads the World by far for killing journalists Israel has a long sordid history of targeting and murdering journalists reporting on its war crimes against the Palestinian people and last month ’ s killing of Palestinian journalist Shireen Abu Akleh should be seen as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s killing hit the headlines because she had such a high profile across the Arab world and was an American citizen .\\nOur government waited a week before issuing an insipid tweet calling for an independent investigation into Shireen ’ s killing .\\nThe US has also been embarrassed into claiming it is deeply upset about the killing – usually the US looks the other way , giving impunity to its racist , apartheid proxy in Palestine .\\nBut journalists in the US are speaking up – even mainstream journalists are beginning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has conducted its own probe into the killing and in part concluded : “ From the strike marks on the tree it appears that the shots , one of which hit Shireen , came from down the street from the direction of the IDF troops .\\nThe relatively tight grouping of the rounds indicate Shireen was intentionally targeted with aimed shots and not the victim of random or stray fire ” Other journalists are also trying to hold the US to account for the impunity it gives to Israeli war crimes : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last night in Los Angeles , Secretary of State Antony Blinken was questioned by journalist Abby Martinabout the killing of Al Jazeera correspondent Shireen Abu Akleh and Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi .\\n“ Secretary Blinken , what about Shireen Abu Akleh ?\\n, ” asked Martin .\\n“ She was murdered by Israeli forces .\\nCNN just agreed to this .\\nThese are our two greatest allies in the Middle East , Saudi Arabia and Israel .\\nThey have murdered American journalists and there have been absolutely no repercussions .\\n.\\n.\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the freedom of press and democracy .\\nThe United States is denying sovereignty to tens of millions of people around the world with draconian sanctions for electing leaders that you do not like .\\nWhy is there no accountability for Israel or Saudi Arabia for murdering journalists ?\\n” “ I deplore the loss of Shireen , ” Blinken responded .\\n“ She was a remarkable journalist , an American citizen…We are looking for an independent , credible investigation .\\nWhen that investigation happens , we will follow the facts , wherever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straightforward as that.\\n” Meanwhile there has been a deafening silence from most journalists about the plight of Julian Assange who has been persecuted by the US and its allies for exposing the truth behind the US pursuit of endless wars around the globe .\\nExposing Israel ’ s horrific record in the targeted killing of journalists is journalism at its best .\\nSilence about the fate of Julian Assange is journalism at its worst .',\n",

       "  'title': 'On The Meaning Of Richard Prosser – A Saddening Post-Mortem',\n",
       "  'content': 'I saw reporting ( at first on twitter , and then in my personal messages ) that Richard Prosser has died .\\nI do not know the details , although the phrase “ after a long battle with depression ” seems to be mentioned , with clear purport .\\nAnother phrase which gets mentioned comes from a certain piece he penned in 2013 .\\nI shall not quote it here .\\nNow I am most definitely not here to defend the remarks in question ( and , hell , a younger me literally lead the charge internally to have something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ; But perhaps it is worth noting that he did not only apologize but actually change his mind after that occurrence .\\nAnd I do not mean simply in the idle sense of merely issuing a press statement to that effect .\\nIf memory serves he went out in person to engage with the community he ’ d hurt through his commentary .\\nBoth to learn and to make some effort at restitution .\\nIt was , reportedly , a humbling experience .\\nNow obviously , the whole thing shouldn ’ t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying ; and while it was positive that some members of NZ ’ s Muslim community were prepared to open homes & dialogue to help him see in an entirely different way .. again , they shouldn ’ t have had to .\\nYet given the way that the conspiratorial fringe goes today – it ’ s a rare thing to have somebody actually do that .\\nGo out , meet what would be described as “ the other side ” , and come away a changed man with changed views in consequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he ’ ll be remembered for , it would seem , is the bad call he made ( and it was abominable ) – rather than the choice to repudiate that & grow .\\nIf we are to turn the death of somebody into a trenchant morality-tale ( and it is the inexorable consequence of having been in the public eye with some prominence that this shall , indeed , occur ) … it seems to me that there is somewhat greater value to be had in that side to it .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ at something done wrong near a decade ago , the ensuing subsequent effort at doing right and renouncing the thing is also at least mentioned .\\nOtherwise , what ’ s the point .\\nAre all such circumstances merely to be ‘ cautionary tales ’ of what not to do , with no corresponding pathway showing what one ought to do where one has already done it ?\\nWhich also does not mean I am here for a moment to pen a glistening and blemish-free hagiography for Richard Prosser .\\nQuite the opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ’ d like to believe , his personal vehemence in favour of ‘ truth-telling ’ in columnry ( even if that ‘ truth ’ could be rather .. divergent from what the rest of us had thought ) would mean he ’ d also appreciate such a principle for his own circumstance .\\nHe most definitely did go down other rabbit-holes both before and after the Wogistan episode .\\nAnd yes , for the past two years there had observably been quite a bit of … stereotypical takes about the pandemic situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other words , the underlying trait of personality which exhibited itself in the form of the adoption of rather … fringe views such as the arguable necessity of South Island Secessionism , lay evidently unameliorated in some respects ) Yet I must confess myself rather uneasy at the notion that that ought comprise the sum total to his recollection among us here today .\\nThe guy who wrote the ‘ Wogistan ’ piece , with various reporting or social media commentary no doubt quoting some choice words or a sentence or two from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that is , rather than merely the column they ’ re drawn from in time .\\nAll up , I guess it ’ s a bit of a curious feeling to see a man one ’ s known for … twelve years , reduced to a single half-a-sentence quote upon a page in such a manner .\\nThere ’ s no doubt that it ’ s a pertinent piece of verbiage .\\nAnd , as I say , the only way that placing it in “ context ” changes anything even an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ context ” of his own repudiation and growing forward from a previous state that should never have existed in the first place .\\nBut that definitely was not all there was to the man .\\nAnd for a number of reasons I do think that deserves to be recognized .\\nEven – indeed , outright especially – in death .\\nIt ’ s the last time many if not most of us shall hear of him in the active sense .\\nIt deserves to be done rightly .\\nPersonally , I ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm-hearted man who even though I vehemently disagreed ( and was quite open about this ) with a very large quotient of what he said ( and I should easily have fitted into several of the categories he ’ d condemn in print ) – he would still go out of his way in his endeavour to help me .\\nWhen I ’ d wound up in some tight spots – suddenly lacking a place to live etc .\\nfor instance , he ’ d reach out , whether to myself or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I needed a place to stay .\\nAnd that ’ s after I ’ d lead an internal effort to have him excoriated / de-selected , had been quoted in media attacking his stuff , etc .\\n( hence , in part , why one of those occasions was a reaching out to ( or , should I say – ‘ through ’ ) ‘ other persons around me ’ – he presumably perhaps thought I ’ d be unlikely to pick up the phone from him directly given the way things were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d like to think that something such as that is also relevant when we are coming to our general assessment as to the proverbial ‘ measure of the man ’ .\\nAgain , fully aware that my experience is very different from somebody who ’ s had no engagement with him suddenly waking up to hear a sitting NZ MP had declared in print one shouldn ’ t be allowed on an aircraft due to one ’ s race / religion .\\nI ’ ll also remember , for what it ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2017 wherein he went into a BusinessNZ event held on that year ’ s election campaign trail , completely accurately stated NZ First ’ s policy of renationalizing part-privatized power-companies ( at no more than price they ’ d been sold for ) … … and for his troubles wound up with David Seymour declaring him to be “ what a f^ < king idiot ” to the assembled doyens of business New Zealand – this remark of Seymour ’ s appearing , on video/audio on the 6 o ’ clock news etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement about how that wasn ’ t the policy , Prosser had been speaking gravely in error etc .\\n… despite the fact that the policy in question was , at the time , still right there on the NZF website for all to see .\\nEvents which , one can argue , appear to be at the very least heavily correlated with what had effectively brought his Parliamentary career to a close ( insofar as the 2017 NZ First List which was announced a few days later had him dropping I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to return back to Parliament as a result ) There is definitely something to be said for terrifying BusinessNZ and ACT about the specter of a socialist takeover of NZ through nationalization of industry .\\nIn any case , while he was still around and I ’ d seen him posting as of a few weeks back ..\\nI have no idea how his personal life had gone .\\nI do recall that he had previously had both wife and child , so my thoughts would also be with them at this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people – to somebody else they ’ re family .\\nAnd it can not be easy to see the name and features of one ’ s father , say , occurrent in such a fashion about the place , especially given what appears to have happened .\\nAll up – I ’ m not here to put forward that pithy rejoinder about the impropriety of “ speaking ill of the dead ” , even imminently following their departure from this globe and context of ours .\\nPeople who genuinely believe in that principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those who don ’ t , well , they shall no doubt do as they do instead .\\nYet men are rarely as simple as the two-dimensional caricatures that we seemingly endlessly re-manufacture of them in our heads .\\nAcknowledging that fact – and presenting a somewhat broader view than just that singular half-sentence of his – does not mean bestowing an uncritical endorsement of a man , their words , deeds , and legacy .\\nIt simply means acknowledging them as human .',\n",

       "  'content': 'On 7 June , a report published by the UN , human rights council group declared that : “ Ending the continued Israeli occupation and discrimination against Palestinians is essential to stopping the conflict and halting the persistent cycle of violence .\\n.\\n.\\n” Our politicians and the news media should take notice also of the UN Human Rights Commission ’ s warning of a ‘ culture of impunity ’ “ fuelling instability and protraction of conflict ” .\\nIsrael benefits from non-recognition of the asymmetrical nature of the conflict and the reality of one immensely militarily-powerful State occupying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report ( A/HRC/50/21 ) is to be presented to the 50th session of the Human Rights Council on 13 June .\\nThe ‘ Jerusalem Day ’ march , at the end of May , saw tens of thousands of fanatical Israeli Zionists marching through the Damascus Gate into the Old City , to celebrate an illegal annexation .\\nPalestinians faced more extreme assaults , both physical and verbal , with Israeli settlers chanting ‘ death to Arabs ’ , among other threats .\\nBefore the march , Israeli police began forcing Palestinian non-residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all Palestinians from entering .\\nMainstream news media reporting of the event was selective and evasive .\\nA BBC TV reporter , Yolande Knell , informed viewers of it in this way , by saying “ usually at this time of day there will be plenty of Palestinians milling around .\\nIsraeli Police have cleared them away.\\n” In one instance , the BBC , facing criticism , admitted that it had made what it called “ an editorial error ” in its removal of Israelis chanting “ Death to Arabs ” from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reinstate the abuse later , following complaints .\\nImagine any other state-approved celebration , with people shouting instead , “ death to Jews ” that would not , quite-rightly , result in headline news-media coverage !\\nIsrael is driven by Zionist imperialism that lays claim to land beyond its internationally-recognised borders .\\nAs the Jerusalem Post notes : “ On Jerusalem Day , it is impossible to catch a view of the capital without an Israeli flag in sight .\\nWhether they are draped over those on their way to the march , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city or attached to car windows , blue and white is everywhere.\\n” The Israeli newspaper summed up Israel ’ s arrogant disregard for Palestinian rights by quoting a Jerusalem Day marcher saying : “ It is important to show everyone that we are marching on Jewish land , which belongs to the Jews and no one else.\\n” Jerusalem Day reflects Israel ’ s so-called 1980 ‘ Jerusalem Law ’ , which declares that : “ Jerusalem , complete and united , is the capital of Israel.\\n” In the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Resolution 478 , declaring Israel ’ s ‘ law ’ “ null and void ” .\\nThe illegal Israeli annexation of East Jerusalem violates several principles of international law which affirm that military occupation of land beyond a state ’ s borders does not afford sovereignty over it .\\nEighty-five per cent of Israel ’ s ‘ separation barrier ’ stands on , and occupies , Palestinian land .\\nIts 422 miles of intricate land-grabbing twists and turns render it more than twice as long as the 199 miles-long Green Line .\\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Palestinian farmers , with land trapped behind Israel ’ s barrier , face huge costs due to restrictions of movement .\\nThe limitations make harvesting difficult and render the land defenceless against acts of agricultural sabotage , such as the destruction of olive trees by settlers .\\nPalestinian homes trapped behind the barrier leave families vulnerable to Israeli settler terror and intimidation .\\nA Kafr Qasim villager , Hani Amer , explained how “ The Israelis told me that I have a choice to make : Either , the wall will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house and I will have to move to the other side of the wall , or they will make our life miserable and we will have to suffer.\\n” Another month has now begun , with Israel the invader carrying out yet another act of population-control terrorism , on the very first day , by bulldozing Palestinian tent-dwellings in Masafer Yatta .\\nThe barbarity of this action is compounded by the fact that the destruction was aimed at families in the villages of al-Markaz and Fakhit , whose homes had already been destroyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media and Western politicians remain largely quiet , dozens of Democrat senators and Congress people in the United States have set an example of concern by signing a letter , calling on President Joe Biden to oppose these violations of human rights .\\nOn 5 June , a United Nations organisation , OCHA , published an alert for the imminent threat of home demolitions in the East Jerusalem neighbourhood of Silwan .\\nThirty-two adults and forty-two children face forcible eviction .\\nThe Israeli invader ’ s military Occupation imposes a dictatorial regime of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are forced to acquire Israeli-issued building permits which are , of course , almost impossible to obtain .\\nAlready this year , 300 Palestinian buildings have either been destroyed or had possession seized , in the whole of the West Bank , including East Jerusalem .\\nThere is more information available on this state-sponsored vandalism , dating back to 2009 .\\nAn independent commission of inquiry , set up by the UN Human Rights Council , notes that Israel has been “ acting to alter the demography through the maintenance of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment for Israeli settlers.\\n” The Public Committee Against Torture in Israel has referred its own country to the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) after concluding that Israel is “ not interested and unable to stop the use of torture against Palestinians ” .\\nIsrael ’ s population-control policy is intended to generate despair – yet despite news media silence and the shallowness of politicians , the remarkable courage and unity of Palestinian resistance has drawn global recognition and understanding .\\nWorld support for defunding apartheid and military occupation through BDS is @ @',\n",

       "  'content': 'I BLAME IT on student politics .\\nThis strange , behind-the-scenes revolution , currently unfolding with minimal media coverage , but making undeniable progress , day , by day , by day .\\nThe “ left-wing ” student politicians of the 1990s , and the people who voted for them , never trusted the majority .\\nThe reason for their mistrust was very simple : they all knew that if a majority of the student body ever got interested in the affairs of their associations , then their “ progressive ” brand of politics was bound to lose .\\nProgressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : by working inside , not outside the system ; making the necessary connections ; and , always , by making sure the dangerous democratic beast remained fast asleep .\\nThirty years later , their “ long march through the institutions ” completed , the modus operandi of these former members of the student political class remains the same .\\nKeep your true intentions hidden .\\nRely upon bureaucratic instruments rather than democratic mandates .\\nUse the power of your political office to shut down opponents .\\nSuborn the media ( easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to avoid unhelpful scrutiny and political accountability .\\nThe central “ principle ” of this form of progressive politics is : “ you have to be in to win ” .\\nAll that truly matters is that the “ right ” people , with the “ right ” ideas , make it into the “ right places ” .\\nOnly then can good things be made to happen .\\nThe halcyon days of student radicalism of the 1960s and 70s , distinguished by the mass participation of the student body in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war in Vietnam , apartheid in South Africa , nuclear disarmament – had , by the end of the 1980s , given way to a desperate attempt to hold on to the “ free ” tertiary education enjoyed by previous student generations .\\nBy the end of the 1990s , however , not even the students ’ obvious self-interest in getting rid of tuition fees was sufficient to generate mass protests .\\nThe student associations , however , remained powerful reservoirs of progressive activism .\\nAstoundingly , given what had happened to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ unions ” continued to be compulsory .\\nAs tertiary student numbers grew , so , too , did the budgets at the disposal of those who controlled them .\\nSince very few students bothered to participate in student association politics , these well-funded shells constituted a large and valuable prize for that dwindling number of progressives who were still “ in to win ” .\\nUnsurprisingly , the small fraction of the student body who were right-wing activists , appealed to their allies in the major right-wing political parties to de-fund these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ membership .\\nSmall wonder that the former student leader , Grant Robertson , fought National ’ s and Act ’ s obliging legislation to the bitter end .\\nOne of the Labour Party ’ s great reservoirs of activist recruits ( the trade unions being the other ) was about to be drained .\\nThat there was no mass resistance to the dissolution of independent student associations ( they survive today only by the grace and favour of the university authorities ) merely confirmed the belief of the progressives that the majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply could not be relied upon to support progressive political activities .\\nIndeed , the only beneficiaries of any successful attempt to stir-up the majority would be the Right .\\nThe brutal reality , as far as these in-to-win progressives are concerned , is that the majority of men are misogynists ; the majority of whites are racists ; and the majority of heterosexuals are homophobes .\\nStir up “ ordinary people ” and all you are likely to get is the equivalent of Brexit and Trump .\\nLeft-wing populism might be good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working-class females – but it could very easily end up being hell for everybody else .\\nBest not to mobilise the masses – especially when preventing them from rejecting politically correct ideas is so very difficult .\\nBesides , a mobilised population is the very last thing that the right people , in the right places , with the right ideas would consider helpful .\\nNot that these in-to-win progressives are about to allow their fear of mobilising the masses to serve as an excuse for inaction .\\nThey have , after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extraordinary power and influence .\\nIn Parliament , the judiciary , the public service , the news media , academia and the arts : all those whom patience has rewarded with institutional power have at their disposal mechanisms which can , if required , compel the compliance of the majority .\\nNot that compulsion is likely to be necessary .\\nThe lessons these progressives learned back in in their student days : keep the student journalists and broadcasters sweet ; don ’ t go out of your way to let people know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure the elected offices of the association are packed with your ideologically-sound friends and comrades ; and don ’ t , under any circumstances , irretrievably alienate the people in the University Registry , the true locus of campus power ; are all readily adaptable to national politics .\\nThe only problem – and it ’ s a big one – is that , unlike student politics , national politics has the Left facing well-organised right-wing opponents .\\nNot every news-media outlet can be nobbled .\\nPeople can be rarked-up by politicians espousing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , worst of all , the turn-out at general elections can climb as high as 70-80 percent .\\nProgressive student politicians always relied upon between half and three-quarters of eligible student voters not bothering to cast a ballot .\\nThough the in-to-win progressives energetically resisted being educated by their examples , there were student politicians who sought nothing more than to represent the majority of the student body .\\nThey weren ’ t progressive , or , at least , not in the way the Left thought of itself as progressive , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary students .\\nMore than that , they knew how to make fun of the Left and its obsessions .\\nStudent leaders like Paul Gourlie and Graham Watson ( who was elected President of the Auckland University Students Association a record four times ) understood that democratic politics is about rousing the majority , not preventing it from waking up .\\nIn the much more dangerous world of the twenty-first century these sort of politicians would be branded populists .\\nThey would not object .\\nNothing frightens the in-to-win progressive more than politicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , but who also listen to the people .',\n",

       "  'content': 'Malcolm Evans reports on an article published on independent UK electronic news platform , The Grayzone .\\nFrom a landslide election victory two years ago to barely surviving a vote of no confidence last week , Boris Johnson ’ s hold on the keys of 10 Downing Street may have been further shaken by “ a bombshell report ” seriously questioning how he came to be PM in the first place .\\nPublished by The Grayzone , an independent electronic news platform founded in 2015 by award-winning journalist Max Blumenthal , “ to shine a journalistic light on America ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the report claims Johnson ’ s election was engineered by “ a clique of current and former defence and intelligence officials backed by shady aristocratic financiers .\\nCiting a tranche of leaked emails and documents , The Grayzone says ; “ they expose the dimensions of a wide-ranging conspiracy managed by a shadowy ‘ cabal ’ of hard-core EU-leavers to sabotage former Prime Minister Theresa May ’ s Brexit deal , remove her from office , replace her with Boris Johnson , and secure a ‘ hard ’ withdrawal from the European Union.\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a negligible fraction of a gargantuan tranche of leaked files .\\nBut even this provides a frighteningly candid glimpse of how power truly operates in Britain , and in whose interests it is ultimately exerted , ” The Grayzone asserts .\\nThe leaked material “ demonstrates that a group of operatives linked to the intelligence services and wealthy , reclusive pro-Brexit financiers spied on campaign groups , infiltrated the civil service , and targeted high-profile UE-remainers with reputational destruction.\\n” While the majority of British voters elected to leave the EU , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agents ” sought to subvert the process and manage it according to their own elite “ hard exit.\\n” .\\nAmong the cabal ’ s key objectives was the strengthening of the security relationship between London and Washington , with the aim of supplanting EU authority with more substantial US oversight .\\nThe tranche of emails , which The Grayzone says would be impossible to counterfeit or to doctor , were shared with it anonymously , but , “ their authenticity has been verified through analysis of the associated metadata , together with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismissed the report as being the work of Russian hackers but , even if that were the case , that doesn ’ t necessarily detract from their validity .\\nIndeed , if , as Malcolm Muggeridge said ; “ News is something that somebody somewhere doesn ’ t want published….. ” it follows that reports like this are most likely to surface as a result of covert activity .\\nAnd there are plenty of examples of major news stories emerging from just such sources ; The Watergate Affair ; The Pentagon papers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for instance .\\nAnd that the media establishment would be disparaging of such material is not surprising , especially when viewed against its refusal to support , or even report on , Wikileaks founder Julian Assange ’ s years-long fight to avoid extradition to the United States , where he faces several life sentences for revealing documents exposing The West ’ s involvement in political espionage , up to and including the commission of war crimes .\\nThat said , it ’ s not as if secret efforts to subvert the tenure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new .\\nWhile the records of the Tower of London attest to the fact that it ’ s been going on for centuries , more recently Harold Wilson ’ s premature exit from office , which the Guardian subsequently described as “ Britain ’ s Watergate , ” was linked to a very serious coup attempt by a cabal of British secret service and British military connections .\\nReporting the affair the Guardian said that , fearing the country was out of control and that Wilson lacked either the will or the desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and military brass plotted to seize Heathrow airport , the BBC and Buckingham Palace .\\nLord Mountbatten was tipped to be the interim Prime Minister and the Queen was to read a statement urging the public to support the armed forces , because the government was no longer able to keep order .\\nAnd then there ’ s the numerous examples of CIA interference in foreign countries ’ elections , not least that reported in Time magazine , July 15 1996 , which details how the US engineered the election of Boris Yeltsin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the US-engineered coup in Ukraine , in 2014 , is directly responsible for the war between it and Russia today , which , as we speak , has the world closer to a global conflagration than it has been since the Cuban Missile crisis of 1962 .\\nAnd then again , as detailed in a recent Chris Trotter article on TDB , there ’ s the example of NZ ’ s own security services , in the mid 1970s , leaking a story to The NZ Truth , “ outing ” Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge of which he was later acquitted ) to undermine his department ’ s influence on New Zealand Government policy .\\nSince the activities of those exposed in the Grayzone article are so flagrantly anti-democratic that they could lead to criminal investigations of at least some of the players involved , the public interest in this report is abundantly clear .\\nThe cabal is reported to be have been led by Gwythian Prins , a member of the Chief of Defence Staff ’ s Strategy Advisory Panel , former NATO and Ministry of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pro-Brexit group Veterans for Britain .\\nAnd he is joined by former MI6 chief Sir Richard Dearlove , who is frequently dubbed “ C ” in the leaked emails , a reference to the operational initial granted to all heads of Britain ’ s foreign intelligence service .\\nThe Grayzone article says Dearlove ’ s MI6 tenure , from 1999 through to 2004 , was typified by controversy .\\nThanks largely to the deceptions he advanced to justify the war on Iraq , Dearlove was ultimately singled out by an official inquiry which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence testifying to the existence of Baghdad ’ s non-existent WMD , to then-Prime Minister Tony Blair .\\nAnd then there ’ s the New Zealand connection ; The Grayzone reports that the cabal ’ s purpose was to ferociously oppose any arrangement that would keep Britain tethered to Brussels ’ defence structures and obligations , contending that it would undermine the US and UK-led ‘ Five Eyes ’ global spying network , of which New Zealand is a member .\\nAmong the leaked files cited in the report is one authored by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spells out the cabal ’ s “ bold and malicious objectives , ” culminating later in an email revealing highly sensitive briefings on EU withdrawal , meant for Prime Minister May , being passed to Dearlove , with Prins declaring , “ Here is her war plan .\\nNow kill her and it.\\n” Funding for what Dearlove described as ; “ A very English Coup d ’ Etat , ” is said to have been supplied by wealthy backers including Tim and Mary Clode , an aristocratic couple based in Jersey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julian ‘ Toby ’ Blackwell , owner of the Blackwell publishing empire , who has an SAS special forces background , is also said to have helped fund the operation .\\nDescribed as , “ an arch Brexiteer and multimillionaire , ” Blackwell ’ s Who ’ s Who entry lists his hobbies as “ fighting Eurocrats and chopping firewood.\\n” A subsequent email from Prins revealed that the covert effort to “ penetrate the enemy ’ s inner councils ” would be led by former SIS ( MI6 Secret Intelligence Service ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm Crosby-Textor .\\nIn April 2019 , Crosby-Textor was exposed as the hidden hand behind a series of bogus social media accounts targeting millions of British voters with ads extolling the virtues of a ‘ Hard Brexit , ’ and urging viewers to “ chuck Chequers.\\n” Boris Johnson took over as prime minister in July 2019 , promising to “ get Brexit done ” after accusing his predecessor and fellow Tory Theresa May of being too soft on Brussels in negotiations .\\nBrexit stepped into effect on 31 January 2020 after months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts to lobby , persuade or engineer political change can be cast in a conspiratorial light , but when the identities of those involved are hidden from the public , and then , when subsequently exposed , are seen to have acted clandestinely , the apostles of democracy have a right to ask ; “ What ’ s going on here ?\\n” All but one of the cabal members and funders exposed in this report ignored repeated requests from The Grayzone for comment .\\nThat lone exception was Evelyn Farr , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil service .\\nReached by The Grayzone at a phone number listed on her CV , Ms. Farr reacted with alarm .\\n“ I don ’ t know what you ’ re talking about , I don ’ t know who you are , or why you ’ ve got this number , and I haven ’ t gotten a clue what you ’ re talking about , ” an audibly startled Farr proclaimed .\\nAnd when asked if she had worked to sabotage the Brexit process from behind the scenes , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the email account of Kit Klarenberg , the Grayzone journalist who wrote this article , has experienced numerous attempted break-ins .',\n",

       "  'title': 'Protecting Freedom/Preventing Harm. Can New Zealand’s New Chief Censor Do Both?',\n",
       "  'content': 'IT IS TO BE HOPED that the new Chief Censor , Caroline Flora , will waste no time explaining herself .\\nIt is important that New Zealanders are told how her old job , Associate Deputy-Director Strategy and Performance , at the Ministry of Health , made her the obvious choice for her new job .\\nAccording to Peter Dunne , the Minister of Internal Affairs responsible for the appointment of Ms Flora ’ s predecessor , David Shanks : “ The Chief Censor is responsible for protecting New Zealanders from material likely to cause harm while balancing the important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clearly , the person tasked with this delicate legal and cultural juggling act should be someone with a solid background in law , and more than a passing acquaintance with philosophy , political history , the arts and literature , film , television , and social-media .\\nAre these the core capacities required of the Associate Deputy-Director Strategy and Performance at the Ministry of Health ?\\nThey may well be , but the prima facie case is not strong .\\nWhich is why Ms Flora owes New Zealand a comprehensive explanation of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to carry out , her role .\\nWhere , for example , is her duty to respect and protect the citizen ’ s right to freedom of expression positioned in relation to her understanding of what is likely to cause society as a whole , or a vulnerable sub-section of it , “ harm ” .\\nHow does she define harm ?\\nA question which , depending on how Ms Flora answers it , will play a central role in how she carries out her new responsibilities .\\nIt is vitally important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to the citizen ’ s right to communicate his or her thoughts and emotions to others , but also to their right to have their thoughts and emotions excited and stimulated by the communications of others .\\nOur own Bill of Rights Act spells it out : “ Everyone has the right to freedom of expression , including the freedom to seek , receive , and impart information and opinions of any kind in any form.\\n” In other words , the right to emulate Shakespeare , as well as the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays .\\nWhat threshold will a book , play , film or video have to cross before Ms Flora bans it ?\\nWould she consider banning the performance of Shakespeare ’ s Merchant of Venice on the grounds that it is antisemitic ?\\nWould she ban a film which presented a young person ’ s decision to transition from female to male in a negative light ?\\nWould she pull from the bookshelves a work of history that purported to prove that the chiefs who gathered at Waitangi in 1840 knowingly surrendered their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she prohibit the distribution of a video depicting Islam as a religion of violence ?\\nOne would hope that the new Chief Censor ’ s answer to each of these questions would be an emphatic “ No.\\n” But , considering the censorious times we are living through , it is , sadly , necessary to ask .\\nFrom the Caucus Room to the Common Room , the urge to shut-down and shut-up those accused of inflicting “ harm ” on others is strong – and getting stronger .\\nIn the United Nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill of Human Rights ” the notion of harm is spelled out in relation to communications inimical to the free exercise , individually and/or collectively , of those rights and freedoms the International Bill of Human Rights was created to protect .\\nThe latter provides for protection of the rights to freedom of thought , conscience and religion , and to freedom of opinion and expression .\\nSignificantly , it also calls for the “ prohibition by law of any propaganda for war and of any advocacy of national , racial or religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostility or violence.\\n” If this is Ms Flora ’ s definition of hateful “ speech ” , then she will find most New Zealanders in agreement with her .\\nIncitement of ‘ discrimination ’ , ‘ hostility ’ and ‘ violence ’ would strike most of us as a sensible test for determining whether material not already defined as “ objectionable ” in the legislation establishing the Chief Censor ’ s office should be deemed so .\\nWere Ms Flora , in explaining herself to her fellow citizens , to refer approvingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classically liberal predecessors , Arthur Everard and Bill Hastings , many of them would breath a large sigh of relief .\\nThey could then feel reassured that the Chief Censor ’ s power to rule a particular instance of communication objectionable ( invoking all the powerful legal sanctions associated with that term ) would be used both wisely and sparingly .\\nThe worry , of course , is that Ms Flora will use the powers of her office to extend its reach into the communication of ideas and policies that , while falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or violence , nevertheless are likely to upset and alarm specific individuals or communities .\\nThe new Chief Censor ’ s background in the upper reaches of the public service raise fears that her institutionally-honed inclination will be to move in the direction of the incumbent government .\\nGiven this Government ’ s growing obsession with misinformation , disinformation and extremism , driven by the Christchurch Mosque Massacres and the Covid-19 Pandemic , it would be helpful to know whether Ms Flora plans to go with the flow , or stand against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fundamental tenets of classical liberalism ?\\nOr , will she be moved by the definitions of extremism supplied last year to the Department of Internal Affairs by the UK-based Institute for Strategic Dialogue ?\\nIf it ’ s the latter , then freedom of expression in New Zealand could take a hit .\\nThis is why the new Chief Censor owes New Zealand a clear explanation of where she stands , and where she would like to go .\\nMs Flora is taking up office in a climate of deepening antagonisms between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the Labour Government ’ s announced intention to criminalise “ hate speech ” is expedited by the new Minister of Justice , Kiri Allan , then the Office of the Chief Censor , along with the Human Rights Commission , will find themselves caught between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea .\\nThe dual mandate set out by Peter Dunne : to protect New Zealanders from “ material likely to cause harm while balancing the important right to freedom of expression ” can only become harder and harder to fulfil .',\n",

       "  'content': 'Central Banks around the world will continue to increase interest rates as part of their policies to end the inflationary consequences of their own expansionary monetary policies in recent years .\\nThese policies feed into rate increases for all forms of debt and a restriction on new lending .\\nAs a consequence , stock markets are crashing , property prices are being hit , government and corporate bond prices are falling , and new investment is collapsing .\\nA generalised economic recession across the capitalist world is an inevitability .\\nMost Central Banks are officially predicting just that and simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nBut to beat inflation the Central Banks also have to start withdrawing the trillions of dollars they have created since the 2008 recession .\\nThe US Fed ’ s balance sheet , for example , has increased from $ 1 trillion to $ 9 trillion since then .\\nAsked at a press conference on May 1 about the effect that balance sheet reduction might have on monetary policy , Powell replied : “ In terms of the effect… I would just stress how uncertain the effect is of shrinking the balance sheet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ models and everyone does in this field and make estimates… And you know , these are very uncertain .\\nI can not really be any clearer.… We don ’ t really know.\\n” This is an incredible admission from the supposed superstars of capitalist economic thinking .\\nCentral Banks worldwide have been invested with a mystique of being virtually infallible masters of the universe .\\nWhat we do know is that each previous time the US Fed has tried to reverse course on money printing the money markets essentially froze and no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nTo prevent a broader collapse money printing was resumed .\\nI explained this in more detail in a December 2020 blog headed “ Printing money to save the power and wealth of the 1 % is just stupid ” .\\nHowever , we now have the need for the system to crush inflation which means that this time the Central Banks will have to sit by and watch as a broader collapse unfolds .\\nThis will begin at the weakest links in the system , impacting the most heavily indebted first .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ and countries are at risk as interest rates rise relentlessly .\\nSimply the promise to increase rates from below zero to above zero by the European Central Bank has created a crisis in Italian government debt which immediately began to be targetted by the “ Bond Vigilantes ” .\\nI ’ ll quote a bit from the payrolled article from the Financial Times reprinted in the NZ Herald on June 15 headed Surging borrowing costs take Italy ‘ close to the danger zone ’ : Investors are questioning how far Italy ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hole through the heavily-indebted country ’ s economy , as a sell-off intensifies across eurozone bond markets .\\nYields have shot higher in the bloc since the European Central Bank last week signalled an end to the stimulus measures it ramped up at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic .\\nECB president Christine Lagarde confirmed plans to withdraw a large-scale bond-buying programme and to initiate interest rate rises next month to tackle record levels of inflation .\\nIn turn , Italy has found itself in the market ’ s crosshairs , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ load of around 150 per cent of gross domestic product .\\nInvestors are dusting off calculations from the eurozone debt crisis a decade ago as they try to understand when the rise in yields could start to imperil finances for the Italian government as well as for companies and households .\\n“ You can tell things are getting bad because people are starting to publish papers on Italian solvency again , ” said Mike Riddell , a bond fund manager at Allianz Global Investors .\\n“ The market isn ’ t panicking yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is starting to feel a little like 2011 , ” he added .\\nBack then , worries over Italian debt sustainability pushed Italy ’ s 10-year yield to a record high of more than 7 per cent .\\nIt touched an eight-year high of 4.06 per cent on Tuesday .\\nThe spread between Italian and German 10-year yields peaked at 5 percentage points at the height of the debt crisis a decade ago .\\nAndrew Kenningham , an economist at Capital Economics , said he did not think the ECB would let it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervene once it reached 3.5 percentage points .\\nThe recently extended average maturity of Italy ’ s outstanding debt , at over seven years , means the recent rise in yields will feed through only gradually to the country ’ s average interest cost , according to analysis by Goldman Sachs .\\nHowever , seven-year borrowing rates have already blown past 2.75 per cent , the maximum level at which Rome ’ s debt load would stabilise , according to the bank .\\nItaly ’ s seven-year debt traded at a yield of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prime minister Mario Draghi ’ s market-friendly government facing elections next year , any political instability “ could well end up being a catalyst for renewed concerns about debt sustainability ” , Goldman Sachs said .\\nInvestors are also watching the gap between Italian and German borrowing costs — the so-called spread — which has widened to 2.4 percentage points , from around 2 percentage points before last week ’ s ECB meeting .\\nFailure to adopt policies to break inflation will simply lead to additional negative consequences as currencies decline in value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % against the dollar because they have resisted the end of easy money policies .\\nThe central bank has pledged to fight so-called “ fragmentation ” of the eurozone financial system , but investors were unnerved by the lack of detail last Thursday on a new “ instrument ” to keep a lid on spreads .\\nFund managers like Riddell who are betting against Italian bonds believe Italy ’ s spread has not yet reached levels that would prompt the ECB to intervene in markets .\\n“ The ECB had the opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , ” said Riddell .\\n“ It ’ s almost an invitation to the market to cause more stress.\\n” Yields surged higher still on Tuesday after Dutch central bank president Klaas Knot told Le Monde that the ECB would not be limited to a half-point rate rise in September — opening the door to a 0.75 percentage point move .\\n“ We are getting close to the danger zone , ” said Frederik Ducrozet , head of macroeconomic research at Pictet Wealth Management , adding that the ease of trading Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand why the ECB is reluctant to move , ” said Ducrozet .\\n“ But .\\n.\\n.\\nif bond yields passed the pain threshold , the re-pricing might become self-fulfilling and the ECB would be unable to stop it unless they step in massively.\\n” As well as the longer maturity profile on its national debt , Rome is also benefiting from more than €210 billion ( $ 351.7b ) of grants and cheap loans from the EU ’ s Next Generation recovery fund .\\nBut the ECB worries about a disproportionate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only because of government debt sustainability , but also because they act as a floor for the overall financing costs for companies and households .\\nIn the first four months of this year , average Italian mortgage rates rose from 1.4 per cent to 1.83 per cent , a three-year high , according to the ECB .\\nThe Italian central bank said the amount of medium- and long-term debt the country has to refinance will increase from €222b this year to €254b next year , which combined with drastically lower purchases by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on yields .\\nRome may have to rely more heavily on Italian financial

       "  'content': 'THERE IS LITTLE to be learned from most of the analyses of the Tauranga By-Election results .\\nThose on the Right continue to present 2020 ’ s general election as a normal contest .\\nIt wasn ’ t .\\nThe 2020 General Election was in fact an aberrant political event .\\nLabour ’ s majority was the product of Jacinda Ardern ’ s world-beating response to the Covid-19 pandemic : a hearty “ Thank you !\\n” from at least half of her “ Team of Five Million ” .\\nThe Tauranga By-Election was always going to register the return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fold .\\nThe result for Labour did not spell “ catastrophe ” .\\nNor did a represent a “ failure ” on Jacinda ’ s part .\\nThe percentages won by the two principal contenders closely matched the 2017 result – exactly as anticipated .\\nThe return of those traditional National voters , while anticipated , nevertheless poses a series of very difficult questions for Labour ’ s strategists .\\nWhile there is comfort to be drawn from the proximity of Saturday ’ s results to those of 2017 , there is absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ s overall 2017 result .\\nFive years ago , Jacinda Ardern did extremely well to lift Labour ’ s Party Vote from 25 to 37 percent , but she still found herself 7 percentage points shy of National ’ s extraordinary ( after three terms ! )\\nParty Vote of 44 percent .\\nJacinda ’ s rather flat speech on Election Night 2017 reflected her understanding that , by failing to win a plurality of the votes cast , she could not expect to become New Zealand ’ s next prime minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , as the photographs taken of Jacinda and Grant Robertson listening to Peters ’ speech make clear , they really didn ’ t know if they had successfully persuaded him to put Labour into power – or not .\\nCertainly , Peters ’ choice ran counter to New Zealand ’ s informal , No .\\n8 wire , post-MMP constitution , which , up until 2017 , had decreed that the party with the most votes got to supply the next prime minister .\\nHad National not been in power for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlikely that Peters would have installed Labour in 2017 .\\nCertainly , a repeat performance ( even assuming NZ First surges back into Parliament in 2023 ) is out of the question .\\nPeters reprising his kingmaker role only makes sense in the political context of an electorate that has undergone a pronounced shift to the right .\\nAn important part of that shift has been the dramatic re-casting of the Prime Minister : from faerie queen and national saviour , to pantomime demon – and worse .\\nA minor party opting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Beehive would provoke nationwide fury .\\nWell aware of this possibility , it is also unlikely that the Māori Party would opt to keep Labour in power – even if it could .\\nBetween them Rawiri Waititi , Debbie Ngarewa-Packer and John Tamihere have more than enough nouse to discern what would happen if they backed a Labour Party beaten into second place by National .\\nYes , they might secure another three years in which to implement the He Puapua blueprint , but it would be against a backdrop of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until te Tiriti and all its works had been cast into the fire .\\nIf the Māori Party ’ s votes could make it possible for National and Act to rule – moderately – then it would be well advised to let them .\\nThe ultimate threat : to pull the pin and bring them down with Labour and Green support ; need never be spoken .\\nChristopher Luxon would have the muzzle he needed for Act – without ever having to ask .\\nThere are no friends in politics – only interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seized .\\nThat said , the victory that now looms ahead for National and Act will not be founded upon an enthusiastic right-wing majority within the electorate , but upon the fatal absence of left-wing support .\\nChristopher Luxon is set to become prime minister not on the strength of those who turned out to support him , but on the disillusionment of those who opted to stay at home .\\nThe historical record tells this story in the most unequivocal terms .\\nIn 1972 , when Norm Kirk romped home to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nThree years later , when Rob Muldoon steamrollered Labour ’ s hopes for “ A New Society ” to dust , it was 82.5 percent .\\nIn 1984 , when Labour again won the Treasury benches , the turnout was a record 93.7 percent .\\nIn 1990 , when Jim Bolger defeated Mike Moore , it had fallen to 85.2 percent .\\nNational Party victories are almost always built on the defeat of Labour voters ’ hopes .\\nIs there anything Jacinda and Labour can do to avert the National-Act triumph that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !\\nIn the simplest terms , they can give their supporters a compelling reason for turning up at the polling-booths .\\nThis time , however , it will take more than rhetorical gestures and snappy slogans .\\nThis time Labour ’ s programme will not only need to spell out a clear sequence of reforms , but also the mechanisms required to implement them .\\nAnd it must be a compelling programme : one that makes losers out of those who have spent the last three decades winning all the prizes ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same 30 years chewing on their leftovers .\\n“ Bottom rail on top !\\n” That ’ s how freed African-American slaves described the transformation wrought by General Army Order No .\\n3 , which on 19 June 1865 – “ Juneteenth ” – gave effect to Abraham Lincoln ’ s Emancipation Proclamation .\\nMāori New Zealanders have never been so close to seeing te Tiriti o Waitangi honoured in practical and enduring ways than they are today .\\nFor this country ’ s bottom rail to make its way to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frame the next election as a straightforward battle between the entrenched colonial legacy of “ old ” New Zealand , and the enlarged democracy of a new “ Aotearoa ” .\\nThe mission of Labour ’ s Māori caucus is clear : to persuade their Pakeha colleagues that they must give rangatahi – young New Zealanders of all ethnicities – a reason to get out and vote .\\nNot only is this the only way that Labour can win another term , but it is also the only guarantee that it will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her caucus need to take a look around the world and note what is happening to those political parties who still cling to the idea that the centre-ground is the safest place to play .\\nLook at what has just happened in the French legislative elections – where the Far-Right and the Far-Left have both made huge gains .\\nObserve the fate of the business-as-usual candidates for the Columbian presidency , and the historic victory of the former revolutionary guerrilla , Gustavo Petro : Columbia ’ s first left-wing President .\\nIn his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers who had fanned out across the nation to “ seduce ” Columbia ’ s voters .\\nAn interesting choice of words , and an accurate one .\\nVictory for the Left has always been a matter of seduction : of making the voters lust for what the Left is offering .\\nAnd if that is not , as Petro told the thousands gathered before him in Bogota , a government of love and hope , then what good is the Left ?\\nWhat is it for ?',\n",

       "  'content': 'WELL , THANK YOU , JACINDA !\\nIn just five years , you and your government have turned New Zealanders decisively against their country ’ s most important trading partner .\\nAccording to research released today by the Asia New Zealand Foundation , the number of Kiwis who view China as a “ friend ” has fallen from 62 percent in 2017 , to just 13 percent today .\\nMeanwhile , the number viewing the People ’ s Republic as a “ threat ” has risen from 18 to 58 percent , over the same period .\\nThis dramatic rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the “ threat ” perception , is the entirely predictable result of a relentless , American-led , campaign to demonise , isolate and “ contain ” China .\\nNew Zealand ’ s “ Five Eyes ” partners , heedless of the economic consequences for New Zealand , have cajoled and bullied its political class into becoming China critics .\\nThey simply do not care that close to 40 percent of this country ’ s trade is with China .\\nNone of them are willing to compensate its loss by opening their markets to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington , London , Ottawa and Canberra are concerned , Wellington is simply paying the price of putting all its milk powder in one basket .\\nIt is difficult to grasp the precise cause of the West ’ s falling-out of love with China .\\nSince the late-1970s , the leading industrial powers have been falling over themselves to invest in the Chinese economic miracle .\\nWithout compunction , or compassion , they relocated Western industrial production to an authoritarian state where labour costs were low and unions docile , denuding in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had kept millions of their own workers gainfully employed .\\nThere were no complaints then about China ’ s lack of democracy , indeed , its absence was pretty much the whole point !\\nAsk them , today , what they were thinking , and they ’ ll spin you the usual yarn about how certain they were that this new , mutually beneficial , economic relationship would lead to the gradual liberalisation of the Chinese regime .\\nJust as it had in the Soviet Union , democracy was coming to the PRC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise and horror when Beijing opted , instead , to combine the Chinese people ’ s economic prowess with the Communist Party of China ’ s authoritarian political impulses .\\nWestern investment hadn ’ t created a friend , it had produced a monster !\\nTo which we are all entitled to call “ Bullshit !\\n” .\\nLet ’ s just consider the counterfactual that China had , indeed , embraced democracy , or something approaching it – a la Singapore .\\nAccording to the West ’ s own theories , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , economically and culturally .\\nIt ’ s people , freed from the tutelage of the Communist Party , would have grown even more confident and productive .\\nIn other words , China ’ s inexorable rise to global economic dominance would have happened faster under democracy than it did under authoritarianism .\\nIt is simply implausible to argue that the United States would have behaved any differently when faced with a democratic Chinese hegemon than it has in relation to the real-world authoritarian China .\\nWhat can be asserted , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then the United States would have found it a great deal easier to destabilise and dominate .\\nThat ’ s the great attraction of democratic political systems to the United States , they are just so pathetically easy to subvert .\\nPick a colour – any colour – and Uncle Sam will organise a “ revolution ” in no time .\\nDon ’ t believe me ?\\nGo ask Serbia , Georgia , Ukraine .\\nOr , dig out Time of 15 July 1996 , and read the Cover Story : “ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Story of How American Advisers Helped Yeltsin Win.\\n” There are , of course , many ways to destabilise and break-up a rival nation .\\nIf its authoritarian political system makes the organisation of a “ colour revolution ” impossible , then a global superpower can always stir up ethnic and religious communities in border regions with sympathetic neighbours .\\nArms can be smuggled across mountain and desert frontiers .\\nJihadists can be schooled in terror .\\nBombs can go off in crowded marketplaces .\\nInnocent people can die .\\nThe Chinese have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have applied the lessons .\\nOnce again it helps to apply the counterfactual .\\nImagine a China whose leaders were unwilling to take the measures necessary to suppress an Islamist insurgency .\\nVery quickly , Xinjiang would have come to resemble Afghanistan , Iraq and Syria .\\nTerrorist atrocities would have become commonplace .\\nBeijing would have been forced to field substantial military and intelligence resources to its autonomous region .\\nCommunal hatreds would have grown and spread .\\nHundreds-of-thousands of the native Uighur population would have fled , or been interned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repression , suffering and death , would it be from the present situation ?\\nNot that these sort of questions are ever posed by the political classes of the Five Eyes powers and their Asian allies .\\nRoughly six years ago , America ’ s strategic thinkers finally abandoned their dream of a democratic China that the USA could control , and began to intensify its parallel policy of containment .\\nAn important part of that effort was the co-ordination of elite opinion across the Indo-Pacific .\\nIt was necessary , now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Chinese – of which New Zealand was a leading exponent – to be abandoned in favour of Washington ’ s new narrative of a dangerous and expansionist China , hellbent on establishing , first , regional hegemony , and then , full global dominance .\\nHow easily that change of narrative was achieved by Washington should prompt New Zealanders to query the robustness of their own democratic institutions .\\nThat there has been no significant divergence of opinion concerning New Zealand ’ s pivot away from its largest trading partner – @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New Zealand ’ s economy and society – should , surely , give us pause .\\nThis country ’ s much vaunted “ independent foreign policy ” stands revealed as rhetoric – not reality .\\nUncle Sam has informed us that New Zealand is at war with Eastasia : that New Zealand has always been at war with Eastasia .\\nDutifully , our politicians , academics and journalists have contributed lustily to the compulsory “ Five Minute Hate ” against the People ’ s Republic .\\nThe “ friend ” that made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat ” to be contained .\\nWhen the export orders dry up – and they will if China decides we ’ ve become her enemy – then we ’ ll have no one to blame but ourselves – oh , and our “ very , very , very good friends ” .',\n",

that everything will be as it was .\\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its allies launched the campaign to “ cancel ” Russia over the conflict in Ukraine , they hoped to crash and undermine the Russian economy and society .\\nThe sanctions have instead boomeranged on their creators , aggravating social and economic problems , driving up the cost of food , electricity and fuel , and hurting the quality of life across the West , but especially in Europe .\\n“ The European Union has completely lost its political sovereignty , and its bureaucratic elites are dancing to someone else ’ s tune , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are told from above , causing harm to their own population and their own economy.\\n” .\\nEU citizens will pay the price for “ decisions divorced from reality and taken contrary to common sense , ” he added , as direct losses from the sanctions alone could exceed $ 400 billion in a year .\\n“ Truly sovereign states are always committed to equal partnerships , ” while “ those who are weak and dependent , as a rule , are busy looking for enemies , planting xenophobia , or finally losing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the overlord , ” Blaming the high energy prices and inflation in the West on Russia – “ Putin ’ s price hike , ” as the White House put it – is a “ stupidity ” and “ designed for people who can not read or write , ” the Russian president said .\\nAccording to the Russian leader , both the U.S. and the EU addressed the Covid-19 pandemic by printing trillions of dollars and euros .\\nPolicies undertaken by EU and U.S. leaders are exacerbating inequalities and divisions in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welfare but in terms of values and orientations of various groups , Putin said .\\n“ Such a detachment from reality , from the demands of society , will inevitably lead to a surge of populism and the growth of radical movements , to serious social and economic changes , to degradation and , in the near future , to a change of elites , ” the Russian leader said .\\nU.S. and EU sanctions against Russia – in particular fertilizer and grain exports – are one of the reasons for growing global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If there is famine in the world ’ s poorest countries , “ this will be entirely on the conscience of the US administration and the European bureaucracy.\\n” Troubles with food supply have arisen over the past several years – not months – due to the “ short-sighted actions of those who are accustomed to solving their problems at someone else ’ s expense , ” distorting the trade flows by printing money in a sort of “ predatory colonial policy , ” Putin said .\\nRussia is ready to send food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the threat of famine is most acute , but faces “ logistical , financial , transport ” obstacles imposed by the West , he said .\\nRussia sent troops into Ukraine in February because the West refused to abide by its obligations , and it was “ simply impossible to reach any new agreements with them , ” Putin said .\\nThe decision was “ forced , but necessary , ” as Russia had every right as a sovereign country to defend its security and protect its citizens and residents of Donbass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and neo-Nazis who received the full protection of the West.\\n” The West spent years turning Ukraine into an “ anti-Russia ” state and pumping it with weapons and military advisers , Putin said , pointing out they “ did not give a damn ” about Ukraine ’ s economy or the lives of its people , but “ spared no expense to create a NATO foothold in the east , directed against Russia , to cultivate aggression , hatred and Russophobia.\\n” “ All the objectives of the special military operation will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nIn the 21st century , sovereignty can not be partial , Putin argued .\\nAll of its elements are equally important and complement each other , and the economy is one of them .\\nThere are five key principles Russia will follow in economic development : Openness , freedom , social justice , infrastructure , and technological sovereignty .\\nRussia will “ never follow the path of self-isolation and autarky , ” but will expand interactions with anyone who wishes to trade , Putin said , adding there are “ many such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprise , build and repair its transportation infrastructure , seek to reduce social inequality , and ensure its key technologies are not dependent on foreign imports .\\n“ Truly sovereign states are always committed to equal partnerships , ” while “ those who are weak and dependent , as a rule , are busy looking for enemies , planting xenophobia , or finally losing their originality , independence , blindly following the overlord , ” he said .\\nThe full article , of which this report is part , can be accessed here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Over , Says Putin| Countercurrents',\n",

the messages must always be the same .\\nOur leaders are good and wise individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employers ’ interests and our own are mutually reinforcing .\\nHonesty and hard work will get us where we want to go .\\nThe Police can be trusted .\\nOh , sure , there are artists out there who challenge each and every one of these myths .\\nBut that ’ s okay , because artists – like the court jesters of old – have been granted special licence to tell the truth .\\nThe Powers-That-Be know that , when we finish reading the artists ’ novels and poems ; when we emerge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; when the concert is over , and the song on the radio has ended ; we , too , will grasp that the glimpses of very different worlds that the artists give us , worlds ruled by very different truths , aren ’ t real .\\nThey are waking dreams – no more .\\nBut then something happened that caused this whole crazy edifice of myths and lies to start shuddering on its foundations .\\nTechnological innovations – the Internet , the Personal Computer , and the World Wide Web – allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-conformist , the revolutionary , the reactionary , and the certifiably insane , to talk to the whole world .\\nCommunication was no longer dependent upon accessing technology that only the very wealthy could afford to own .\\nSuddenly , the simple myths were being overwhelmed , and the accepted truths challenged .\\nAs the subversively cheap technology became increasingly powerful and the platforms for new and unorthodox ideas multiplied , the Powers-That-Be found their privileged voices lost among a multitude – millions of men and women all shouting their personal truths ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprisingly , the Powers-That-Be became furious and frightened .\\nNothing solid could withstand these huge and constantly surging tides of information , misinformation and disinformation .\\nThe foundations of the great towers of societal and ideological certitude were undermined , washed away , brought low .\\n“ No wonder so many young people are having mental health problems !\\n” They ’ re not the only ones !\\nThe half of society that still needs and believes in the media ; that still clings tightly to all the old myths ; struggles to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nIt ’ s unsettling , and it ’ s getting harder .\\nWhy ?\\nBecause the Powers-That-Be are also losing their wits .\\nDesperate to keep control , politicians , journalists , and all those other manufacturers of our consent , cast about for some way to stuff the genie of universal communication back in its bottle .\\nIt ’ s not the infinite multiplication of truths that enrages them .\\nIt ’ s that they have lost their monopoly on lies .',\n",

.\\nI didn ’ t meet Dennis Brutus until 2009 when I made my only trip to South Africa .\\nIt was such a pleasure to meet this elder statesman of anti-apartheid activism , with his dramatic shock of white hair , and undimmed passion for justice .\\nI was envious of his hair I have to say – for obvious reasons !\\nI ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we need to do when a liberation movement becomes a barrier to liberation .\\nBut to set the context I ’ m going to talk a little bit about 1976 because it ’ s a year where South Africa , New Zealand , colonialism , apartheid and Dennis Brutus intersected .\\nIn fact I first became aware of Dennis ’ s name in 1976 at the time of the Montreal Olympics when he was working hard with others in the anti-apartheid struggle .\\nUnfortunately at the time , this colonial country of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kith and kin ” in white South Africa and a government minister had farewelled the All Blacks touring apartheid South Africa by saying the team went with “ the goodwill and blessing ” of the New Zealand government .\\nIn fact to the fury of most of the world our All Blacks were playing the Springboks during the Soweto uprising – which had its 46th anniversary last week .\\nBlack school children were being murdered in the streets of South Africa in their hundreds ( 600 black children were killed between 16 June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the All Blacks entertained the supporters of the white regime .\\nEarlier that same year our Prime Minister Rob Muldoon had castigated Abraham Ordia , the President of the Supreme Council for Sport in Africa and refused to meet him when Ordia came to New Zealand .\\nMuldoon infamously said “ Ordia can stew in his own juice ” .\\nAfter this insult Ordia left New Zealand early and the follow up played out in Montreal later in the year where African countries tried to have New Zealand excluded from the games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zealand thrown out of the games was lost , 29 African and Caribbean countries boycotted the games because New Zealand was there .\\nThere was an immediate sequel to this decision which is important to remember .\\nThe glamour event of those games was to be the 1500 metres with Filbert Bayi from Tanzania facing John Walker from New Zealand .\\nBut Tanzania joined the boycott and a front-page photo in newspapers here showed Filbert Bayi packing his bags in his room at the Olympic village to head home .\\nBayi said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boycott because the freedom of black South Africans was more important than his personal desire to winner an Olympic medal .\\nNeedless to say , John Walker won the 1500m run .\\nThe most important observation however is that Filbert Bayi ’ s sporting integrity is not so common today in elite professional sport dominated by contracts , money and greed rather than the selfless human solidarity expressed by the Tanzanian runner .\\nOver the past several decades I have been a strong critic of the African National Congress and its failure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that works for people rather than big business monopolies .\\nIn the 28 years since the ANC was elected to power in South Africa the rich have got richer and the poor have continued to struggle .\\nTwo weeks ago I was reading about ANC leader and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and allegations of corruption around his reputed $ 450 million in personal wealth and I immediately thought of a dinner I attended as a guest of an African state in the early 1980s .\\nIt was in part as acknowledgement for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Springbok tour protests of 1981 which had such an impact at home and , although we didn ’ t know it at the time , an important impact in South Africa .\\nAs an aside here , because there are students attending .\\nIn 1981 Nelson Mandela was in prison on Robben Island and told us later that when the prisoners heard we had stopped the Hamilton game they rattled their cell doors right around the prison and made a hell of a racket .\\nHe said “ it was like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lunch at a flash restaurant on a boat moored in the Thames River in London .\\nI was taken aback with these diplomats ordering hugely expensive French wines and discussing how their children were getting on at flash private English boarding schools .\\nNeedless to say back in their home country education for the majority was rudimentary at best and life opportunities limited .\\nThe “ justification ” was that this is what white politicians did this so why shouldn ’ t black politicians do the same ?\\nThey saw it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see and sense the same attitudes in the ANC leadership today .\\nHowever nothing sums up the ANC today better than the single word – Marikana .\\n34 striking mineworkers were massacred by South African police at Marikana .\\nRamaphosa was on the Lonmin mining company Board of Directors and instead of arguing for mediation and negotiation – he urged determined police action against the mineworkers .\\nHe sided with wealthy shareholders against the workers .\\nMarikana was the ANC ’ s Sharpeville massacre and Ramaphosa was a key perpetrator .\\nOver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ champion under apartheid in the 1980s to liberation leader , to collaborator , to sell-out , to apologist , to brutal oppressor .\\nThe ANC ’ s transition from liberation movement to guardian of the rich is now complete .\\nRamaphosa himself has a reputed $ 450 million fortune .\\nLet ’ s be honest hear – no-one ever gets half a billion by their own efforts – it can only be done either through legalised theft – or just plain theft – there is no other way .\\nSo how did this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take place .\\nI think two things are important here .\\nFirstly the “ turning ” of the ANC leadership away from its core principles and values .\\nThe Americans have an expression for how this is done – they call it “ elite-pacting ” .\\nIt refers to a strategy of targeting the top officials in a group you want to turn and lavishing them with luxury while working to convince them that free market economics is the only way forward .\\nSo the leading figures in the ANC were targeted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economics seminars in the US to be followed by all expenses paid holidays in flash resorts in Florida or the Caribbean where they were wined and dined .\\nThey became “ pacted ” with top US officials and quickly ended up slavishly following US dictates about the free-market economic direction the ANC must follow .\\nSecondly , most activists tell me they were looking the other way when South Africa ’ s fate was decided in the early 1990s – before the first vote was cast .\\nActivists were campaigning to prevent various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scrum in favour of whites by undermining the negotiations around the constitution .\\nMeanwhile a small group of ANC leaders around Thabo Mbecki were meeting regularly with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund and giving them assurances free-market capitalism would be the backbone of the South African economy under the ANC .\\nThe problem for the people of South Africa was that they put their trust and faith in the ANC leadership – trust which was rapidly betrayed .\\nBlack South Africans have gained civil and political rights but oppression based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on class – and not much else has changed .\\nCan the ANC be reformed to become a liberation movement once more ?\\nNo .\\nEven if the majority of members wanted this to happen it couldn ’ t .\\nIt ’ s simply not possible to reform such an organisation from within .\\nI can ’ t think of any precedents which would encourage such a belief .\\nI ’ ve met many members of the ANC who heavily criticise the organisation but end up saying “ the ANC , warts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always will be ” .\\nBlind loyalty will always be a barrier to liberation .\\nWhat about the Economic Freedom fighters ?\\nDo they offer a way forward ?\\nNo .\\nThey are also tied in with loyalty to personality and their political programme , from what I have seen , has been patchy , inconsistent and incoherent .\\nSo an alternative movement needs to emerge where loyalty is entrusted to a political programme which transcends the vagaries of personality-led leadership .\\nI ’ m not usually one for quoting other people but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Che Guevara .\\n“ Liberators do not exist .\\nIt is the peoples who liberate themselves ” I interpret the message here to be that loyalty to each other and loyalty to a political programme is the way forward – not loyalty to leaders .\\nWhere the movement becomes more important than its political programme or when loyalty to leadership takes over from the drive to enact political policies to benefit the majority – the seeds of political failure have been sown and fertilised .\\nMany of us , myself included , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or other and we know how difficult it can be to develop and drive a movement based around a political programme .\\nSo how does South Africa move forward ?\\nIt would be arrogant of me to tell South Africans what they should be doing but South Africa has at least two examples from its political history and current practice worth looking at in this context .\\nThe “ Freedom Charter ” movement of the 1950s was a successful attempt to develop loyalty to a set of political principles on which the liberation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an outlawed organisation at the time and this was an attempt to build political opposition to apartheid with a set of political principles at the focus .\\nHowever , the Charter with its radical principles was gradually side lined as the ANC developed strength around the personality of Nelson Mandela – a great liberation leader but when elected President was unable to develop and press forward a political programme to significantly improve the lives of most black South Africans .\\nThe other example is the basic organising work being done by Abahlali @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are taking people from where they are – not from where they want them to be , or where they think they should be – but from where they are facing the struggle to meet their basic necessities in life .\\nThe wrong way is to come up with a blueprint and tell people this is the way forward .\\nThe blueprint has to be developed by people on the ground themselves .\\nIt also has to be based around the actual situation people find themselves in – and the words must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and passion .\\nNone of this is easy – if it was we would all be living in a socialist utopia by now .\\nThere are no middle-class saviours for the poor and oppressed in a free-market capitalist society but all of us have talents and gifts to help amplify a political struggle and build a movement which transcends any one organisation and pushes ahead through linking up , sharing experiences , arguing , debating and discussing .\\nIn this way we build that wider movement and bring strength , integrity and people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meantime the ANC will slowly wither away , but like a whale carcass the decay will take a long time and it won ’ t be pretty .\\nAnd as it loses support and begins to collapse in on itself the leadership will resort to the tried and true tactics of race baiting – just as Mugabe did in Zimbabwe .\\nThrough it all the movement needs to grow stronger , personalities taking second place to goals , principles and strategies .\\nA liberation movement learns from its component organisations and brings forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big global issues like climate change , human rights abuses and the endless wars to promote free-market capitalism .\\nI hope these observations and suggestions will provide some food for thought .\\nI know they exercised Dennis ’ s mind when I met him in 2009 .\\nThe struggle was his life .\\nI want to finish with a short poem – the very first poem by Dennis in the book called “ Poets to the People ” edited by Barry Feinberg in 1974 .\\nIt ’ s a poem which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of its words to convey political messages through righteous anger .\\nIronically the book this poem comes from is dedicated “ To South Africa ’ s political prisoners and to the African National Congress and its allies ” .\\nDennis would have had plenty to say about that !\\nWe have no heroes and no wars That flower under lashing rains of hate We have no battles and no fights For history to record with trite remark And accidentally dyings in the dark Yet when the roll of those who died To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise these nameless unarmed ones will stand beside the warriors who secured the final prize Thank you for listening , thank you for having me .',\n",

       "  'content': 'WHETHER OR NOT ABORTION emerges as a major issue following next year ’ s elections depends on National ’ s candidate selections .\\nNational lost 13 seats in 2020 , and on current polling can be reasonably confident about reclaiming most of them in 2023 .\\nMuch then depends on the beliefs – pro-choice or pro-life – of the candidates selected over the next few months .\\nIf National replenishes its caucus with pro-life MPs , and ACT emerges with a reasonable number of pro-lifers in its own , then the debate may well be rekindled .\\nThe reignition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainty , however , if Brian Tamaki is successful at bringing together the fractious Far-Right political parties under a single banner .\\nShould his new conservative coalition crest the 5 percent MMP threshold , the outbreak of an American-style culture war will be very hard to prevent .\\nMoreover , if Labour and the Greens sustain significant losses in 2023 , as current polling suggest they will , then that war will be very hard to win .\\nCertainly , a woman ’ s right to a safe and legal abortion would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs will not be attributable entirely to the electoral success of the Far Right .\\nIn both Labour and the Greens , a defeat of sufficient magnitude to bring the likes of Tamaki ’ s Christian soldiers into Parliament , will likely generate a particularly vicious backlash against the social-radicalism which conservative leftists will be quick to blame for their party ’ s punishment at the polls .\\nAfter all , it ’ s not as if Labour ’ s te Tiriti-driven , feminist and LGBTQI factions will be able to point to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation to poverty , housing , health and education – quite the reverse , in fact .\\nWorking-class party members ( if any remain ) will have every reason to demand a thorough-going purge of middle-class social-radicals from Labour ’ s ranks .\\nA similar purge , mutatis mutandis , will sweep away the identarian Greens .\\nIf such purges do not eventuate , and the two left-wing parties remain in the grip of identity politicians , social-radicals and ethno-nationalists , then it is difficult to see them making a swift recovery at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voting public is likely to cast about for a political movement less alienating , and more encouraging , of “ mainstream ” electoral support .\\nIf the rightward tendencies within Labour and the Greens do not succeed in providing these conservative left-wing voters with such a vehicle , then they will call forth somebody better equipped to offer them a ride .\\nHistorically , however , the damage inflicted by such right-wing re-settings of left-wing parties ’ ideological compasses is enormous .\\nConvinced that a Labour Party as left-wing as Norman Kirk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rightward elements that would eventually give New Zealand “ Rogernomics ” spent fifteen years destroying Labour as a party of economic redistribution .\\nAfter years of bitter factional strife , the party ’ s left-wingers were finally driven from its ranks .\\nLabour only survived to reclaim the Treasury Benches in 1999 on account of being restrained from veering too far from its electoral base by the competitive presence of Jim Anderton ’ s Alliance and Jeanette Fitzsimons ’ and Rod Donald ’ s Greens .\\nThe New Zealand of the 2020s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zealand of the 1990s .\\nOur thoroughly digitalised society no longer possesses the human resources capable of creating new political parties dedicated to the nation-building and/or nation-restoring missions of the Alliance and NZ First .\\nCorny though it may sound , at the heart of these two essentially patriotic electoral projects lay an undeniable love of country .\\nThirty years on , the creation of political movements is driven much more by the voters ’ intense hatred of what their enemies : neoliberals , colonisers , patriarchs , heterosexuals – take your pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where once the urge was to build and/or restore , today ’ s activists seek only to tear down , punish and destroy .\\nIn relation to the issue of abortion , these destructive and punitive impulses will make it virtually impossible for the debate to proceed on a rational , let alone a civil , basis .\\nIndeed , the very idea that those on both sides of the abortion issue might be decent and caring individuals , whose opposing positions are based on reasonable and eminently defensible philosophical propositions , religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will be rejected as dangerous nonsense .\\nPro-lifers are no such thing , they are simply misogynistic religious bigots .\\nPro-choicers stand condemned as monsters for whom human life matters less than personal convenience .\\nIn these circumstances , simply to raise the issue of abortion is to set up the conditions for the most reckless expressions of hatred and loathing .\\nIn the Age of Twitter , Tik-Tok and Instagram , which is to say , in the Age of Declarative Solipsism , extremism will always arrive on the battlefield firstest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , that Christopher Luxon is so determined to make sure that the battle never takes place .\\nSometimes , as the US Supreme Court may yet discover , to its cost , doing nothing is the only sensible thing to do .',\n",

       "  'content': 'WILLIE JACKSON HAS A PROBLEM – a big problem .\\nSince 2017 , he has led the charge to secure more resources for Māori and , by winning them , has assumed a pivotal political role in the quest for tino rangatiratanga .\\nWith Jackson ’ s successes , however , have come heightened expectations of more .\\nJust how high Māori hopes have grown is manifested in the contents of the Draft Plan for implementing the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples ( UNDRIP ) So alarming are the recommendations contained in this document , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present it to Cabinet .\\nJackson ’ s refusal is highly significant .\\nIf the plan has a promoter of Māori economic and social development as stalwart as Jackson shaking his head , then the Draft Plan must be effectively indistinguishable from the He Puapua Report .\\nTherein lies Jackson ’ s problem .\\nThe moment the He Puapua Report entered the public arena it was too late to order it shredded .\\nIt had become a ticking political time-bomb that could only be defused with the co-operation of all sides of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only saving grace was that it was not – yet – an official government document .\\nThis was a godsend for Jackson and the Labour Government .\\nThey had been given a few crucial months to do whatever was needed to prevent a potentially fatal political explosion .\\nIt explains why Jackson and his colleagues asked Maoridom to develop its response to the UNDRIP/He Puapua challenge first , ahead of Pakeha , and behind closed doors .\\nThey were hoping that , perceiving the explosive character of the Plan , the good and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their powers to reshaping its recommendations into something Jackson ’ s Labour colleagues – and the rest of New Zealand – could live with .\\nUnfortunately for Jackson and Labour , that is not what happened .\\nAfter 70 hui , held across the country , the mood of Maoridom was made strikingly clear .\\nUNDRIP was a hard-and-fast commitment .\\nThe radical vision of He Puapua was not to be to be finessed away with fine phrases .\\nRangatahi , the rising generation of young Māori nationalists , would accept nothing less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-governed and bi-cultural Aotearoa .\\nHow radical is the Draft Plan ?\\nIt is revolutionary .\\nHow else to describe its call for one justice system for Pakeha and another for Māori ?\\nThe late Moana Jackson would be proud of the document , because , essentially , it reflects his vision of the future .\\nThe softly-spoken revolutionary ’ s body may lie with his ancestors , but his spirit is strong among that part of Maoridom for whom Tino Rangatiratanga and Mana Motuhake have become non-negotiable components of Aotearoa ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided not to come through for him , or Labour , must have hit Willie Jackson hard .\\nSo hard that he was forced back onto that most traditional of Labour precepts : the fundamental decency and common sense of the New Zealand working-class .\\nJackson ’ s interim solution to the Draft Plan ’ s ideological inflexibility is to divide the intellectuals and ideologues responsible for He Puapua from ordinary , hard-working , Māori New Zealanders : “ I know what the average Māori will think and they ’ re not walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nations ’ Declaration of Indigenous Peoples – they ’ re thinking about their housing , their health , their education.\\n’ ’ This would sound a lot more convincing if Jackson ’ s Pakeha colleagues had not been aggressively selling the notion that Māori housing , health and education will only improve when the rest of New Zealand starts living up to Te Tiriti o Waitangi ’ s implicit promise of “ partnership ” .\\nGenerally-speaking , working-class people have more on their minds than politics .\\nBut , they aren ’ t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and politics are intimately entwined often enough , and loudly enough , and , eventually , they ’ ll start paying attention .\\nQuite unintentionally , Labour may have kicked-off a revolution of rising expectations .\\nSuch is the essence of Jackson ’ s problem : he can neither withdraw , nor water-down , the Draft Plan without exposing the Labour Government to the most withering political fire .\\nHis Pakeha colleagues face the same problem – in reverse .\\nIf the Labour Cabinet signs up to a dual legal system , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good-bye .\\n“ You can imagine some of the wants or asks from [ Māori ] , but as I remind them , it ’ s not just about them .\\nIt ’ s about what do we want to do as a government and how do we want to honour that declaration and how do we realistically go forward getting people to recognise there are indigenous obligations without them thinking we ’ re going to take their houses off them.\\n’ ’ Which is , of course , why the revolutionary He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment it passed from the hands of the Māori nationalist dreamers who wrote it , into the possession of those who do politics for a living .\\nStill , it ’ s an ill wind that blows nobody no good .\\nLabour ’ s crisis is Te Pāti Māori ’ s red , white and black opportunity .\\nAny watering-down , let alone withdrawal , of the Draft Plan will be seized upon by Rawiri Waititi and Debbie Ngarewa-Packer as proof positive of Pakeha Labour ’ s perfidy .\\nAfter five years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pledges to institute co-governance , the Labour Government will have proved that , when push comes to shove , it is no more willing than any other coloniser to surrender its white privilege .\\nAnd to Jackson ’ s colleagues in Labour ’ s Māori caucus , Waititi and Ngarewa-Packer will jeer : “ Fool me once , shame on you : fool me hundreds of times , and I must be a Māori Labour Party MP !\\n” Except , being roundly castigated by Te Pāti Māori just might be the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upholding democracy by rejecting the separatist recommendations of the Draft Plan is probably the only way this Government can remain electorally

       "  'content': 'Addressing the NATO military alliance summit on 30 June , the New Zealand Prime Minister , Jacinda Ardern , informed s : “ Aotearoa New Zealand has a fiercely held independent foreign policy.\\n” What she called “ our foreign policy interventions ” were based , she said , on “ the simple concept that , when our shared humanity is undermined , we all suffer.\\n” Ardern described the war in Ukraine as “ an affront to our multilateral institutions ” and , stressing the need to “ speak out against human rights abuses at all times ” , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure on the international rules-based order ” .\\nFollowing such clear pronouncements , it is reasonable to request our Prime Minister to explain more clearly her policy towards Israel ’ s land-grabbing oppression of the Palestinian people .\\nIn her speech before the NATO military alliance , Jacinda Ardern referred to New Zealand ’ s “ significant contributions to the international legal effort to hold Russia accountable ” so it is fair to ask her what significant contributions the present Government has made , or at least intends to make , in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imposition of the longest military occupation in modern history .\\nEstablished last May , by the UN Human Rights Council , the first report from the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory , including East Jerusalem , and Israel condemns the military occupation as well as Israel ’ s discriminatory treatment of the people it has invaded .\\nNoted in the report is : “ Israel ’ s failure to uphold the laws and customs of war , including those of belligerent occupation , violations and abuses of individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of accountability.\\n” These crimes certainly count as among what Jacinda called “ the mounting pressure on the international rules-based order.\\n” There is much talk of negotiations as the way to resolve the injustices but , as the UN report notes , Israel “ has established clear policies to ensure complete permanent control over the Occupied Palestinian Territory .\\nThis includes altering the demography of these territories through the maintenance of a repressive environment for Palestinians and a favourable environment for Israeli settlers.\\n” It would be more honest to admit that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there can be any hope for peace and justice in Palestine .\\nZionism is , as the report finds , “ altering the demography of these territories through the maintenance of a repressive environment for Palestinians and a favourable environment for Israeli settlers.\\n” “ Israel ’ s policies and actions build Palestinian frustration and lead to a sense of despair .\\nThey fuel the cycle of violence and the protraction of conflict ” , as the Commission ’ s Chair , Navanethem Pillay explained .\\nIsrael and its allies gladly use reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resistance to make Israel ‘ s invasion and Occupation appear more like defence than aggression .\\nArmed struggle against colonial occupation is recognised under international law and specifically endorsed through the adoption of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 , as a protected and essential right of all people living under occupation .\\nOver time , this right has been defined more and more clearly and , in 1982 , UNGA resolution 37/43 removed any doubt as to the lawful entitlement of occupied people to resist occupation forces by any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legitimacy of the struggle of peoples for independence , territorial integrity , national unity and liberation from colonial and foreign domination and foreign occupation by all available means , including armed struggle ” .\\nThe UN Human Rights Commission report notes that Israel has “ no intention of ending the occupation ” and is indeed aiming for “ complete control ” over the Occupied Palestinian Territory .\\nIn the UK Parliament ’ s House of Lords , the Tory Member , Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon , in answer to a question regarding this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , weakly responded : “ We firmly believe a just and lasting resolution that ends the occupation and delivers peace for both Israelis and Palestinians is long overdue.\\n” Ignoring the asymmetry and purpose behind the conflict , he then promised : “ We will continue to press Israel and the Palestinians strongly on the need to refrain from taking actions , which make peace more difficult.\\n” The US Government response to the UN report defied reason , logic and undeniable evidence , saying : “ we firmly oppose the open-ended and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rights Council ’ s ( HRC ) Commission of Inquiry ( COI ) on the situation in Israel , the West Bank , and Gaza , which represents a one-sided , biased approach that does nothing to advance the prospects for peace .\\nThe report of the Commission , released today , does nothing to alleviate our concerns.\\n” It is the failure to recognise undeniable aggression that is “ one-sided ” and “ biased ” – it would seem that , for Israel ’ s allies , “ promoting respect for human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere but in Palestine .\\nOn 24 June , our Ministry of Trade and Foreign Affairs ( MFAT ) announced that New Zealand ’ s application to become an Observer of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance ( IHRA ) had been accepted .\\nAs Sh ’ ma Koleinu – Alternative Jewish Voices ( NZ ) tells us , the IHRA ’ s controversial working definition of anti-Semitism “ renders criticism of Israel as Jew-hatred.\\n” Last month , the IHRA membership , at its annual plenary gathering in Stockholm unanimously elected Israel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would surely better fit New Zealand ’ s “ fiercely held independent foreign policy ” for us to detach from , and indeed oppose such views , which do nothing but grant immunity for Israel .\\nA UN report to the Human Rights Council in March noted that : “ There is today in the Palestinian territory occupied by Israel since 1967 a deeply discriminatory dual legal and political system , that privileges the 700,000 Israeli Jewish settlers living in the 300 illegal Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem and the West Bank.\\n” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopt a robust menu of accountability measures to swiftly end the occupation and enable Palestinian self-determination .\\nAs Ardern herself tells us , “ we must stand firm on the rules-based order , call for diplomatic engagement and speak out against human rights abuses at all times when and where we see them.\\n” So what are we waiting for ?\\nIn the UK on 2 July , Jacinda addressed a meeting at Chatham House , also known as the Royal Institute of International Affairs , telling this audience also that “ we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the war in Ukraine that New Zealand had “ moved swiftly to enact a targeted regime of sanctions in condemnation of the war.\\n” It is high time for New Zealand to demonstrate our fiercely-held independent foreign policy by moving swiftly to “ enact a targeted regime of sanctions in condemnation of the war ” in Occupied Palestine .\\nSet an example to world leaders , especially our so-called allies !',\n",

       "  'content': 'The face of New Zealand and democracy has changed dramatically in the past few years and we need to reflect New Zealand ’ s new identity and democracy in our main media entities .\\nHAS NEW ZEALAND ’ S DEMOCRACY really “ changed dramatically ” in the past few years ?\\nI suppose it all depends on how you define “ democracy ” , “ dramatically ” and “ the past few years ” .\\nLet ’ s start from there , and then work on to explore the motivation behind such a bold political assertion .\\nThere are very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boast a continuous democracy as old as New Zealand ’ s .\\nOur population became fully enfranchised in 1893 when the Liberal Government extended voting rights to women .\\nThe United States would not reach that democratic milestone until 1920 , and women would not be fully enfranchised in the United Kingdom until 1930 .\\nIf one of the key indicators of a democratic nation is the right of its people to vote in fair and regular elections , then New Zealand can hold its head high .\\nAnother feature of a working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the majority of voters is reflected in the character and composition of their government .\\nIn this regard , New Zealand ’ s record is less exemplary .\\nSince the acquisition of self-government in 1852 , New Zealand has experimented with a number of electoral systems .\\nThe “ Two Round System ” , for example , pitted the two highest polling candidates of an initial open round of voting against each other in a second run-off ballot .\\nIt was designed to ensure that , ultimately , a Member of Parliament represented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It lasted from 1908 until 1914 .\\nOthers , like the system which featured the “ Country Quota ” , were intended to weight the votes of electors living in rural areas more heavily than those of urban voters .\\nThis blatantly anti-socialist measure lasted from 1881 until 1945 !\\nUnderpinning both of these reforms , however , was the electoral system known as “ First-Past-The-Post ( FPP ) .\\nTo win an FPP election it was necessary for a candidate to win more votes than any of his/her rivals .\\nNot more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combined , you understand , but just a simple plurality .\\nThe candidate with the mostvotes ( which may , or may not , have constituted a majority of the votes ) won .\\nObviously , FPP can easily lead to a situation in which the governing party was able to win a majority of parliamentary seats with considerably fewer than half the votes cast .\\nIn an election where three or four parties of roughly equal strength are seeking the electors ’ support , the outcome is not Majority Rule , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nSince it is clearly unhelpful , in terms of preserving political legitimacy , to have a clear majority of voters feeling unrepresented , the grim arithmetical logic of FPP drives the political class inexorably towards a rigid two-party system .\\nIn the 1920s and early-1930s , New Zealand voters had three major parties to choose from : the Reform Party , the Liberal ( later the United ) Party , and the Labour Party .\\nIn no election between 1919 and 1938 did any single political party ever secure more than half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Zealand only boasted a rough two-party system for five elections ( 1938 , 1943 , 1946 , 1949 , 1951 ) The Labour/National duopoly was broken in 1954 with the advent of the Social Credit Political League .\\nIt would take until 2020 for a single New Zealand political party to , once again , secure more than half of the popular vote .\\nThe switch from FPP to Mixed Member Proportional Representation ( MMP ) in 1996 was certainly the most dramatic change to New Zealand ’ s democratic machinery since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ – New Zealand ’ s unelected ( and largely decorative ) Upper House of Parliament – in 1950 .\\nNew Zealanders voted for MMP in response to what was widely perceived as a lack of democratic political agency .\\nWith Labour and National both committed to neoliberal economic and social policies , many New Zealanders felt politically disenfranchised .\\nVoters dreamed of electing Parliaments in which heterogeneous assemblages of genuine representatives would enable the formation of governments much more closely attuned to the people ’ s will .\\nTheir hopes were not fulfilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ select candidates more reflective of the gender , ethnic and sexual-preference makeup of the New Zealand population , but the House of Representatives remained dominated by National and Labour .\\nThose smaller parties that managed to make it into Parliament dutifully lined-up with one or other of the two major parties in coalitions that only very rarely produced anything even remotely challenging of the neoliberal status quo .\\nRegardless of the drama , or lack of it , it would seem that , over the course of the last 100 years , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules have been changed , the more its fundamental political impulses have remained the same .\\nIt is , however , possible to make one important observation : the larger the winning party ’ s share of the popular vote ( now known as the Party Vote ) the more permanent its subsequent alterations to the country ’ s face tended to be .\\nThe problem , of course , is that these alterations are all-too-often executed without a mandate .\\nThe last time a political party sought , and got , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New Zealand it was 1972 .\\n( Some might say 1938 ! )\\nCertainly , over the past 35 years , the biggest and most alarming instances of facial surgery ( Rogernomics , Ruthanasia ) have been accomplished without the patient ’ s informed consent – or an anaesthetist !\\nIt is to be hoped that Willie Jackson ’ s use of the past tense when describing the dramatic changes to the face of New Zealand democracy is inadvertent .\\nIt is certainly difficult to make a case for the will of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier to impose today than it was 30 years ago .\\nThe “ tyranny of the majority ” that Willie complains of finds no confirmation in our political history : neither in the Pakeha world , nor Te Ao Māori .\\nThe truly scary thought is that Willie sees the obstacles to achieving effective democratic majorities as a feature , not a bug , of our present system .\\nIf his idea of a new and improved New Zealand democracy is one in which , once again , the most determined minorities get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is describing is not so much an uplifting electoral drama , as a political sucker-punch to the face .',\n",

Countering Violent Extremism ( CPCVE ) .\\nJackson ’ s strong academic record in conflict research made him an excellent choice to lead the new centre , the establishment of which had been recommended by the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Christchurch Mosque Shootings .\\nIt was not to be .\\nOn the 1 March 2022 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the point of being signed , the content of a confidential internal review of the National Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies was leaked to The Otago Daily Times .\\nThe content of the leaked report was unsparing in its criticism of the Centre .\\nWhat was most noteworthy about the criticisms quoted in the ODT , however , is that they appeared to be focused , almost exclusively , on its alleged failings to meet the University of Otago ’ s bi-cultural expectations .\\nThe ODT reported that the review “ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not until the centre ’ s culture was ‘ considerably improved ’ because at present it would be a culturally unsafe environment for new Māori staff.\\n’ ” Some hint of the ideological leanings of the review ’ s author/s may be gleaned from the ODT ’ s reference to their remarks concerning the Centre ’ s interest in the histories of Parihaka and Rekohu ( Chatham Islands ) : “ The centre was also criticised for a tokenistic commitment to biculturalism .\\n“ While it received praise for its efforts in starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Parihaka and Rekohu , it was called out for the narrowness of its approach and for having a poor grasp of appropriate indigenous protocols .\\n“ The strategic inclusion of indigenous groups was a ‘ well-known divisive settler colonial practise ’ , which the centre needed to avoid.\\n” It is difficult to read such comments without concluding that the review is part of a much larger and destructive conflict between the Centre and those elements within the University of Otago charged with ensuring that there is no deviation from the te @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protocols mandated by the University authorities .\\nThe bitterness of this conflict is made clear in the following excerpt from the ODT ’ s report : “ It said staff appeared to be of the view the Aotearoa New Zealand Peace and Conflict Studies Centre Trust ensured the continual financial viability of the centre , when in reality , the university was increasingly having to underwrite an operating deficit .\\n“ Staff also believed they were heavily overworked , while by university standards their teaching workloads were light .\\n“ The centre was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seems to assume , ’ the review said.\\n” One can only speculate that the Centre , by virtue of its independent source of funding , the Aotearoa New Zealand Peace and Conflict Studies Centre Trust , believed it could hold out against the demands of the bi-culturalists in the University administration .\\nThe fate of Professor Richard Jackson is , therefore , salutary .\\nClearly , the University of Otago feels obliged to shoot the occasional professor – pour encourage les autres .\\nJackson ’ s rejection by the DPMC is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerning the appointment of the CPCVE ’ s foundational directors .\\nFisher ’ s article setting out the whole , rather odd , story is .\\nEven more disturbing , however , is the idea that the DPMC ’ s strategic coordinator for counter terrorism in the National Security Group , Andy George , and National Security senior policy adviser Julia Macdonald , who sat on the selection panel , appear to have allowed a document positively reeking of academic rancour to de-rail the appointment of Jackson .\\nDid it not occur to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , might have it in for the man they were about to appoint , and that the leaking of the “ confidential ” internal review might have been intended to bring the appointment process to a shuddering halt ?\\nAs persons closely bound up with this nation ’ s security , did they not feel obliged to dig deeper into the whole affair ?\\nWere they not struck by the near perfect timing of the leak ?\\nWere they not in the least bit curious about how the leaker knew when to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they like to have known who it was who was passed-on that presumably confidential information ?\\nAfter all , the direction taken by the CPCVE in its quest to prevent and counter violent extremism in New Zealand is a matter of no small importance .\\nIndeed , our national security may well hinge upon the direction in which the new directors – Professors Dr Joanna Kidman and Paul Spoonley – choose to look for those most likely to launch terroristic violence against their fellow New Zealanders .\\nIf , for example , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups and Islamophobes , is it possible they might miss the emergence of potentially violent extremists ?\\nIn the event that a National/Act Government emerges from the 2023 General Election , and within the first 100 days of coming to office abolishes the Three Waters Reform and the Māori Health Authority , is it not likely that the country ’ s political temperature will spike ?\\nAnd if David Seymour ’ s proposal to enshrine the meaning of the Treaty of Waitangi in law becomes law , and then progresses towards a national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s fever rise still higher ?\\nCan the National Security Group , in need of all the help it can get to prevent and counter violent extremist acts , have confidence that the CPCVE will be bringing its attention to bear on furious groups of Māori ethno-nationalists ?\\nIt would be comforting to believe that the identification of potential violent extremists by the CPCVE will in no way be influenced by ideological factors , and that the New Zealand taxpayers who are footing the bill for its investigations can be absolutely certain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremism are not themselves extremists .\\nSurely , that would have constituted a key aspect of the National Security Group ’ s brief from the DPMC ?\\nAnd yet , the disturbing question remains : Was the person , or persons , responsible for leaking the “ confidential ” internal review of the Centre for Peace & Conflict Studies worried that if Professor Richard Jackson became Co-Director of the CPCVE , he might feel obligated to investigate potential threats to the peace and tranquillity of New Zealand ?\\nIs that why it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not proceed ?',\n",

       "  'content': '“ If it bleeds , it leads ” is an old newsroom aphorism which acknowledges that the more horrific the story the more people will be attracted to it .\\nBut , since by defintion such stories often deal with human tragedy , it ’ s only human nature that people , needing to know what happened so that they might empathise , would be attracted .\\nAnother old media maxim , which appeals to a less savoury aspect of human nature , that of wanting to know the forbidden , hidden or the salaceous , goes ;

       "  'content': 'SKY NEWS AUSTRALIA has reformulated Jacinda Ardern ’ s championing of “ kindness ” as “ performative caring ” .\\nWhile the network has long displayed a strong right-wing bias , its derogatory re-casting of the New Zealand Prime Minister ’ s “ brand ” may nevertheless strike a chord with the growing number of her detractors on this side of the Tasman .\\nSky News ’ owners have a very real interest in undermining Ardern ’ s support in New Zealand .\\nWhile she remains the Shaky Isles ’ prime minister she will continue to remind Australian voters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politicians .\\nIt ’ s a comparison Australian conservatives could do without .\\nEspecially when it encourages Aussie voters to focus on the extraordinary unloveliness of the Liberal and National parties ’ leadership .\\nHence Sky News ’ willingness to do all it can to aid their ideological soulmates in the New Zealand Parliament .\\nThe sooner Ardern ’ s Gospel of Kindness is laid to rest , the sooner Australians can be reconciled to the unchangeable nature of the monstrous regiment of boofheads that has dominated their politics for decades .\\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Act make use of the rhetorical gift Sky News ’ Rita Panahi has given them .\\nOf Iranian extraction , Panahi won her spurs as a right-wing political commentator by heaping criticism on the Islamic radicalism her family had fled .\\nNow firmly ensconced in Rupert Murdoch ’ s stable of conservative columnists , Panahi ’ s ability to deliver political invective is not to be sneezed at .\\nThat said , however , echoing the Aussie sledges of a Kiwi PM may not be the most sensible way to win the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nEven if National and Act decline Sky News ’ hatchet , there can be little doubt that the “ performative caring ” slur will spread rapidly : mostly by social media , but also through plain , old-fashioned word-of-mouth .\\nThat it will damage Ardern ’ s “ brand ” is indisputable .\\nHow could it not , when the Ardern Government ’ s successful demonstrations of practical kindness are so very thin on the ground ?\\nPerhaps aware that it is not generally regarded as either fair or sensible for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prime-minister of that country ’ s oldest ally , Sky News ’ morning line-up were careful to back their “ performative caring ” jibe with corroborative evidence .\\nPanahi , in particular , pointed to Labour ’ s dismal failure to keep its promises to the New Zealand electorate .\\nNot surprisingly , she homed-in on the Ardern Government ’ s failure to build the tens-of-thousands of affordable houses it had promised to supply .\\nNew Zealanders could supply many more examples .\\nWhere was the kindness – the empathy – in Health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to acknowledge the obvious crisis gripping New Zealand ’ s health service ?\\nWhere was even the most basic manifestation of political common sense ?\\nHow is any government served by its ministers refusing to acknowledge truths plainly visible to the entire country ?\\nEvery New Zealander acquainted with reality knows that what the doctors and nurses are telling the news media is true .\\nIf they haven ’ t witnessed personally the tragic overloading of the country ’ s primary and emergency health services , then their family and friends have filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating well below optimum staffing levels is relived every day in their own workplaces .\\nBetween them , the Omicron variant of Covid-19 and the winter flu are infecting New Zealanders by the tens-of-thousands .\\nOwners and managers are at their wits ’ end , trying to keep their farms , factories , shops and offices functioning .\\nThey can all-too-easily imagine the stress of doctors and nurses struggling to do the same – only with the lives of their patients potentially at risk if they make the wrong decision .\\nLittle ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis ” is , of course , entirely rational from a cynically political point of view .\\nWere he to recognise it , he would then be morally obliged to take the necessary steps to fix it .\\nAnd how could he possibly do that when the entire health system is in the midst of a complex restructuring process which he , himself , initiated ?\\nTo remove the enormous pressure on medical personnel would require immediate and effective action from the Department of Immigration , and the full co-operation of the gate-keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long lorded it over the nation ’ s health system .\\nWith a clear-sighted grasp of the crisis , coupled with an iron will to overcome it , both of these objectives could be achieved .\\nNow , if we could only lay our hands on a clear-sighted health minister with an iron will !\\nIn 2020 , Kiwis were bowled over by a government that actually delivered on its promise to fight the global Covid-19 pandemic with kindness .\\nAstonished , they watched it slap down a business community demanding profits before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Zealanders rewarded “ Jacinda ” and her Labour Government with an extraordinary election victory .\\nAnd why not ?\\nTheir government had not only cared , it had performed .\\nThat was the secret sauce ; the cipher key ; the magic formula : telling people what you were hoping to do – and then asking them to assist you in making it happen .\\nSo long as the people remain at the heart of a Government ’ s performance , it can not fail .\\nIf objectives aren ’ t being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens for their help , listen to their advice , and back their assistance with dollars .\\nFor a few months this is exactly what Ardern did .\\nIt worked .\\nAnd the country loved her for it .\\nThe problem , of course , is that listening to the people can get a government into all kinds of trouble .\\nIt is also extremely difficult to sustain .\\nIt requires a very special political talent to recognise the voting public as the country ’ s most important interest group , especially when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is telling you that it ’ s the business community , Treasury , the Reserve Bank , academic experts , the news media .\\nTurned out Ardern simply didn ’ t have enough of that special talent .\\nTurned out 2020 was a fluke .\\nSix months of genuine kindness was the most “ Jacinda ” could summon forth .\\nAnd when she could no longer make it , she faked it .\\nSadly , “ performative caring ” sums up Jacinda Ardern and her Labour Government very nicely .',\n",

or retaining sufficient Pakeha support to remain in office , even at the cost of alienating enough of Labour ’ s Māori support to make the formation of the Māori Party a realistic proposition .\\nIt would be fascinating to know just how far the electorate ’ s opposition to Labour ’ s policies of “ co-governance ” extends .\\nGiven the extent of its polling and focus-grouping , one can only assume that Labour ’ s strategists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolling out the policy as currently configured .\\nWere it not for National ’ s and Act ’ s clear determination to exploit the Pakeha public ’ s fear of co-governance , it would be easy to assume that only a small minority of the population are sufficiently exercised by the ideas contained in the controversial He Puapua Report to make them the key determinants of their voting choices .\\nThat National and Act are unwilling to give away the co-governance issue ( as Key gave away National ’ s opposition to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Labour ’ s policy is shaping-up to be one of the hottest “ hot-button ” issues of 2023 .\\nThe only explanation for Labour ’ s Pakeha majority ’ s consistent refusal to jettison the party ’ s commitment to co-governance is its fear that such a decision would spark a full-scale revolt in its Māori caucus .\\nA revolt so serious that the mass desertion of Labour ’ s Māori MPs to the Māori Party could not be ruled out .\\nIn such circumstances , neither the continued loyalty of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labour caucus , could be counted on by the Labour leadership .\\nThe resulting parliamentary crisis could only be resolved by calling a snap election .\\nCould the adoption of “ The Danish Solution ” rescue Labour ?\\nMuch would depend on how effectively the Labour leadership presented the range of choices confronting the electorate .\\nIf National and Act could be presented as the radical right-wing alternative , whose extremist policies would almost certainly spark serious civil strife , Labour would be able to present itself as a moderate hand-brake on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Party and the Greens .\\nAdroitly handled , Labour could emerge from the crisis as the only party capable of keeping the peace .\\nAs such it could call upon the electorate to give it the numbers in Parliament to frustrate the reactionary plans of the Right and the revolutionary programme of the Left .\\nNational and Act would gnash their teeth in fury .\\nThe Māori Party and the Greens would condemn Labour as sell-outs , moral cowards and traitors .\\nBut when the smoke cleared , Labour would find itself finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Maoridom – those would now belong to the Māori Party exclusively .\\nFrom this position , Labour could advance itself as the only reliable defender of te Tiriti o Waitangi and the democratic and egalitarian principles it embodies .\\nAn altogether preferable alternative to Labour fading into political irrelevance , as a triumphant Right lays waste to New Zealand ’ s three most precious taonga : Egalitarianism , Democracy – and the Treaty itself .',\n",

       "  'content': 'THE UNITED STATES OF CONSPIRACY is a Frontline documentary by Michael Kirk , Mike Wiser , Jim Gilmore and Philip Bennett .\\nIt examines the rise of conspiratorial politics in the United States from the early 1990s until the election of Donald Trump – paying particular attention to the role played by Alex Jones and his online vehicle , Infowars , in the weaponisation and normalisation of conspiracy theories .\\nThe influence of Jones ’ falsehoods on the style and content of Trump ’ s campaigning was immense .\\nThe documentary makers ’ claim that conspiracy theories now constitute an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as troubling as it is true .\\nThe assumption , after Trump and QAnon , is that the weaponisation of conspiracy theories is primarily ( some would say exclusively ) a strategic innovation of the Right .\\nBut , what if the counterfactual – that conspiracy theories have their origins on the Left – turned out to be true ?\\nWhat if , ever since the triumph of neoliberalism in the 1980s and 90s , a consistent and increasingly complex web of left-wing conspiracy theories has been woven around that ideology ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project as the conscious product of a collection of right-wing individuals who , working largely in secret , had set out to undermine and dismantle the entire social-democratic post-war economic order .\\nA cabal whose long-term objective was to make it impossible for social-democracy to ever again threaten the dominance of Capitalism ’ s economic and social elites .\\nTo such a claim , the Left would immediately raise the objection that the above description of neoliberalism ’ s success is not a conspiracy theory , but the plain and simple truth .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mt Pelerin Society , the notorious Powell Memorandum , the plethora of right-wing think-tanks , and such elite retreats as Bohemian Grove and Davos .\\nThe Left ’ s claim would be that neoliberalism didn ’ t just happen , it was organised by flesh-and-blood human-beings .\\nConspiracies belong to the Right , they ’ d say , for the very simple reason that the outcomes intended by the conspirators inevitably involve impoverishing the many for the profit of the few .\\nThe Left ’ s position on conspiracy theories is , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t need them .\\nThe Right , on the other hand , has no choice except to conspire behind an opaque curtain of lies .\\nBluntly , it can not afford to tell the truth .\\nBut if conspiracy theories are nothing more than politically-inspired deceptions , a definition which The United States of Conspiracy more than justifies , then where does that leave the claims of ( for want of a better term ) the “ Woke Left ” ?\\nThe quality that most distinguishes Alex Jones ’ conspiracy theories is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them .\\nJones rages , he weeps , he shouts at the camera and shakes his fists .\\nOnly very rarely does he communicate with his followers in a calm and reasoned fashion .\\nIt ’ s as if he is compensating for the lack of facts and evidence in his wild claims , by directing ever more extreme displays of anger and disgust towards the individuals and groups he is attacking .\\nIt is when the fetid atmosphere created by the Right ’ s toxic accusations and denunciations is at its thickest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring most easily to mind .\\nIf the level of emotion on display , and the strength of the invective used , is inversely related to the truth of the claims being advanced , then the veracity of a great deal of contemporary left-wing discourse must surely be called into question .\\nOn the issues of race and gender particularly , the Woke Left ’ s almost instant recourse to accusation and denunciation is alarmingly reminiscent of Alex Jones and his imitators .\\nThere is the same determination to discipline , punish and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upholders of heretical doctrines .\\nMost alarming of all is the shared proclivity of the Conspiratorial Right and the Woke Left to dehumanise their opponents .\\nAlex Jones describes his enemies as “ demons ” , the Woke Left brands its enemies as racists , fascists and TERFs .\\nNaturally , these highly emotive defences of Woke political positions raise questions about whether or not they can be validated by more rational , evidence-based , discussion .\\nIt has always been the Left ’ s mission to convince by means of reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demolition of its foes ’ arguments by assembling a battering-ram of verifiable facts .\\nThis process can not be successful if the right of those to whom the Left ’ s case is being made to interrogate its facts is denied .\\nFacts can not be asserted , facts can only be proved .\\nUnfortunately , the Woke Left is not at all disposed to proving its facts in the cut and thrust of open political debate .\\nIt offers dogma .\\nIt punishes heresy .\\nBut it is only rarely willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Alex Jones , his disgusting conspiracy theories , are , fortunately , easy to refute .\\nThe 9/11 attacks were perpetrated by Al Qaeda , not the US Government .\\nThe Sandy Hook Elementary School Massacre was a devastating human tragedy , not a “ false flag operation ” performed by actors .\\nThe Queen of England is not a shape-shifting lizard .\\nHilary Clinton is not a demon from hell .\\nThe Comet Ping-Pong pizzeria is not the epicentre of a diabolical Democratic Party paedophile ring .\\nSadly , the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Woke Left .\\nThat the Māori chiefs at Waitangi never signed away their sovereignty ; complainants of sexual assault never lie ; biological sex is a social construct ; may or may not be statements of fact , but they are beyond doubt claims of extraordinary political significance .\\nWhat The United States of Conspiracy reveals is the extreme danger posed to the coherence of contemporary societies by the unprecedented lack of a generally agreed means of determining what we know , and how we know it .\\nThe most dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one that declares there ’ s a whole host of dangerous people out there who simply will not accept that ours is the only side that knows the truth .',\n",

       "  'content': 'CONFRONTED WITH THE CHALLENGE of a worsening cost-of-living crisis , what would a democratic-socialist government do ?\\nRight now , answering that question coherently and believably is the Left ’ s most important assignment .\\nThe Right ’ s response to this challenge is relatively clear : throw the economy into recession , maintain strong downward pressure on aggregate demand ; reduce public spending .\\nThe Centre-Left ’ s approach to the crisis differs in no serious respect from the Right ’ s .\\nIt hopes to achieve the same goals , using the same methods , but in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is masked by the rhetoric of “ kindness ” .\\nUnfortunately for Jacinda Ardern and her Cabinet , there is no “ kind ” way of bringing inflation under control while remaining within the ideological parameters of neoliberalism .\\nThe classical definition of inflation : too much money chasing too few goods ; more or less writes the neoliberal government ’ s policy for it .\\nThe first and most important objective is to reduce the amount of money in circulation .\\nNeoliberals achieve this key goal by raising the cost of borrowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay more , leaving households with less to spend .\\nThe price of capital also rises , applying the brakes to business expansion and investment .\\nIn the face of these developments the labour market contracts : raising the level of unemployment , increasing workers ’ fear of “ the sack ” , and setting off a steady decline in real wages .\\nIn short order , the problem of too much money in too many people ’ s pockets simply disappears – along with their cash and credit .\\nBut wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a farmer can not make a dollar by supplying the market with one cabbage , then he will supply it with two .\\nThere will be more cabbages to buy , and at a lower price .\\nAnd there you have it !\\nThe cost of living falls .\\nThe inflationary tide recedes .\\nThe problems confronting neoliberal economists and politicians are solved .\\nAll well and good for the neoliberal economists and politicians , but not in any way good for the human-beings on the receiving end of their decisions .\\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the neoliberals ’ perspective , is that they save them from having to deal with the devastating micro effects of their policies .\\nThey don ’ t have to witness the expression on workers ’ faces when they ’ re told that their employer is “ letting them go ” .\\nThey don ’ t hear the sobs of the young couple leaving the house they struggled so hard to buy , but whose mortgage they can no longer afford .\\nThe small businessman who can not make the numbers add-up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffers alone – a casualty of the “ creative destruction ” of “ market forces ” .\\nThe real-world effects of a neoliberal government ’ s economic policies occur in places where the politicians who set them in motion seldom visit .\\nIn the long run , though , everyone is better-off for having helped to beat inflation and bring the cost-of-living under control .\\nSuch is the refrain of the neoliberal decision-makers .\\nIt is a bleak sort of consolation , akin to that of the General who praises the sacrifice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them killed by the murderous ineptitude of his military tactics .\\nThere are ways to win battles that do not necessitate slaughter .\\nThere are ways to beat inflation that do not depend on simultaneously beating-up the nation ’ s poorest and most vulnerable citizens .\\nBut , what are these ways ?\\nHow can inflation be beaten without inflicting economic pain on the weakest members of society ?\\nFor democratic-socialists the answer lies in using the enormous power of the state to regulate the economy .\\nExactly the same power that neoliberalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privilege of the capitalist elites .\\nBecause the power of the state does not have to be used to keep the private sector profitable .\\nThe power of the state could just as easily be used to freeze mortgage rates , cap the prices of necessities , and control rents ; to raise appreciably more revenue from its wealthiest citizens ; and to levy “ windfall ” taxes on all those corporations guilty of racking-up excessive profits during the Covid-19 pandemic .\\n( Even Boris Johnson ’ s Conservatives did that ! )\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ government could remove GST from basic food items .\\nIt could re-nationalise and centralise the generation and distribution of electric power , and then retail it to citizens at an affordable price .\\nA democratic-socialist government could nationalise the public transportation system and make it free for everyone .\\nA democratic-socialist government could even impose a “ Carbon Footprint Tax ” on imports .\\nOnly among neoliberals are “ subsidy ” and “ tax ” dirty words .\\nTo be fair to Jacinda and her Finance Minister , Grant Robertson , they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and public transport .\\nThey have also provided many New Zealanders with a “ Winter Energy Payment ” .\\nThese are good moves , but they are nowhere near enough .\\nSadly , the full mobilisation of the state ’ s powers to bring down the cost-of-living , tax excess wealth out of circulation , and reconfigure the ownership of what are , in truth , “ social ” industries for the benefit of the many , not the few , is still beyond the range of this Government ’ s political imagination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robbed Labour of the courage and creativity that , in the 1930s and 40s , made New Zealand a model democratic-socialist state .\\nConservatives reading this post will shriek “ Muldoonism !\\n” And , they will be right .\\nBut there is another way to look at Rob Muldoon ’ s economic management , apart from using it as shorthand for everything that was wrong with New Zealand in the 1970s and 80s .\\nIt is possible to recast Muldoon ’ s policies as proof of how deeply ingrained the determination to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had become in the New Zealand political system .\\nMuldoon subsidised and regulated and controlled because the alternative – letting “ market forces ” rip – would leave far too many casualties in its wake .\\nWhen Rob Muldoon promised “ New Zealand the way want it ” – he meant it .\\nThat the Labour Party was willing to inflict those casualties ; that to keep the good opinion of Treasury and The Business Roundtable it was willing to abandon its democratic-socialist principles ; and that , to this very day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neoliberal dogma it can not seem to abandon ; strikes me as a far greater crime than any Rob Muldoon may have committed .\\nIn the end , even the Springbok Tour made New Zealand a stronger country .\\nBut , neoliberalism has not made New Zealand a stronger country , it has made it weaker .\\nWhen the instinct of both their major parties is to use the nation ’ s weakest citizens as economic cannon-fodder , then surely it is time New Zealanders made “ neoliberalism ” a dirty word ?\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ has only ever left humanity with more that is cruel , and less that is kind .\\nIt is not what democratic-socialists do .',\n",

       "  'content': 'A lively 43sec video clip surfaced during last week ’ s Pacific Islands Forum in the Fiji capital of Suva — the first live leaders ’ forum in three years since Tuvalu , due to the covid pandemic .\\nPosted on Twitter by Guardian Australia ’ s Pacific Project editor Kate Lyons it showed the doorstopping of Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare by a melee of mainly Australian journalists .\\nAn aloof Sogavare was being tracked over questions about security and China ’ s possible military designs for the Melanesian nation .\\n• Australia and New Zealand ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and human right But Lyons made a comment directed more at questioning journalists themselves about their newsgathering style : “ Australian media attempt to get a response from PM Sogavare , who has refused to answer questions from international media since the signing of the China security deal , on his way to a bilateral with PM Albanese .\\nHe stayed smilingly silent.\\n” Prominent Samoan journalist , columnist and member of the International Federation of Journalists ( IFJ ) gender council Lagipoiva Cherelle Jackson picked up the thread , saying : “ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacific doorstop approaches.\\n” Lagipoiva highlighted for her followers the fact that “ the journos engaged in this approach are all white ” .\\nShe continued : ‘ A respect thing ’ “ We don ’ t really do this in the Pacific to PI leaders .\\nit ’ s a respect thing .\\nHowever there is merit to this approach.\\n” A “ confrontational ” approach isn ’ t generally practised in the Pacific – “ in Samoa , doorstops are still respectful.\\n” But she admitted that Pacific journalists sometimes “ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hard questions when PI leaders would “ disregard local journalists ” .\\n“ Even though this approach is very jarring ” , she added , “ it is also a necessary tactic to hold Pacific island leaders accountable.\\n” So here is the rub .\\nWhere were the hard questions in Suva — whether “ western or Pacific-style ” — about West Papua and Indonesian human rights abuses against a Melanesian neighbour ?\\nSurely here was a prime case in favour of doorstopping with a fresh outbreak of violations by Indonesian security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now deployed in Papua and West Papua provinces — in the news coinciding with the Forum unfolding on July 11-14 .\\nIn her wrap about the Forum in The Guardian , Lyons wrote about how smiles and unity in Suva – “ with the notable exception of Kiribati ” – were masking the tough questions being shelved for another day .\\n“ Take coal .\\nThis will inevitably be a sticking point between Pacific countries and Australia , but apparently did not come up at all in discussions , ” she wrote .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ put off is China .\\n“ Pacific leaders have demonstrated in recent months how important the Pacific Islands Forum bloc is when negotiating with the superpower.\\n” Forum ‘ failed moral obligation ’ In a column in DevPolicy Blog this week , Fiji opposition National Federation Party ( NFP ) leader and former University of the South Pacific economics professor Dr Biman Prasad criticised forum leaders — and particularly Australia and New Zealand — over the “ deafening silence ” about declining standards of democracy and governance .\\nWhile acknowledging that an emphasis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcome , he said : “ Human rights – including freedom of speech – underpin all other rights , and it is unfortunate that that this Forum failed in its moral obligation to send out a strong message of its commitment to upholding these rights.\\n” Back to West Papua , arguably the most explosive security issue confronting the Pacific and yet inexplicably virtually ignored by the Australian and New Zealand governments and news media .\\nThe final PIF communiqué failed to mention West Papua .\\nIn Suva , it was left to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Australia West Papua Association ( AWPA ) and the Fiji Women ’ s Crisis Centre ( FWCC ) to carry the Morning Star banner of resistance — as West Papua ’ s banned flag is named .\\nThe Fiji women ’ s advocacy group condemned their government and host Prime Minister Bainimarama for remaining silent over the human rights violations in West Papua , saying that women and girls were “ suffering twofold ” due to the increased militarisation of the two provinces of Papua and West Papuan by the “ cruel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Sydney-based AWPA said the Fiji Forum was a “ missed opportunity ” to help people who were suffering at the hands of Jakarta actions .\\n“ It ’ s very important that West Papua appears to be making progress , ” he said , particularly in this Melanesian region which had the support of Pacific people .\\nIntensified violence in Papua The day after the Forum ended , Pacific Conference of Churches ( PCC ) general secretary Reverend James Bhagwan highlighted in an interview with FijiVillage how 100,000 people had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ land of Papua ” .\\nHe said the increasing number of casualties of West Papuans was hard to determine because no humanitarian agencies , NGOs or journalists were allowed to enter the region and report on the humanitarian crisis .\\nReverend Bhagwan also stressed that covid-19 and climate change reminded Pacific people that there needed to be an “ expanded concept of security ” that included human security and humanitarian assistance .\\nIn London , the Indonesian human rights advocacy group Tapol expressed “ deep sorrow ” over the recent events coinciding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escalating violence by Jakarta ’ s security forces and the retaliation by resistance groups .\\nTapol cited “ the destruction and repressive actions of the security forces at the Paniai Regent ’ s Office ( Kantor Bupati Paniai ) that caused the death of one person and the injury of others on July 5″ .\\nIt also condemned the “ shootings and unlawful killings ’ of at least 11 civilians reportedly carried out by armed groups in Nduga on July 16 .\\n“ Acts of violence against civilians , when they lead to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be condemned , ” Tapol said .\\n“ We call on these two incidents to be investigated in an impartial , independent , appropriate and comprehensive manner by those who have the authority and competency to do so .\\n”',\n",

       "  'content': 'In a joint statement released on 13 July , the Foreign Ministries of nine countries , Belgium , Denmark , France , Germany , Ireland , Italy , the Netherlands , Spain and Sweden , rejected Israel ’ s accusations of terrorism or links to terrorist groups levelled against six Palestinian civil society organisations .\\nThe statement noted that Israel had failed to produce any evidence that would justify reviewing their nations ’ policy towards these NGOs .\\nIn the US , twenty-two members of Congress sent a letter , demanding President Biden also reject Israel ’ s unsubstantiated accusations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israel , Defence for Children International-Palestine , says : “ Our human rights documentation and evidence-based advocacy exposing Israeli forces ’ grave violations against Palestinian children have made us a target of the Israeli government for years .\\nBut we will not back down.\\n” The family of Shireen Abu Akleh , the Palestinian journalist shot dead , while reporting a raid by Israeli Occupation forces on a Palestinian refugee camp in Jenin , have written to US President Joe Biden , accusing his Administration of seeking “ erasure of any wrongdoing by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at what they felt amounted to betrayal , the family deplored an evasive statement , released by the State Department on 4 July .\\nThe statement resulted from an enquiry , overseen by the regional US security co-ordinator , Lt. Gen. Michael Fenzel , into the shooting that : “ found no reason to believe that this was intentional but rather the result of tragic circumstances.\\n” Several independent investigations , including one by the United Nations , concluded that Shireen was shot by Israeli forces , describing the action as “ targeted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as “ well-aimed.\\n” Her death was referred to the International Criminal Court .\\nYet still , the Israeli Government refuses to take responsibility .\\nAs witnesses have confirmed , she was shot and killed deliberately , anyone who came to help her was also fired upon .\\nThe direction from which the shooting came was made clear , thanks to Israeli human rights group B ’ Tselem videos as well as examinations of video and audio evidence of the killing — by the Washington Post , CNN , The Associated Press , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United Nations Human Rights Office .\\nAs Shireen ’ s family told the US President : “ Your administration ’ s actions can only be seen as an attempt to erase the extrajudicial killing of Shireen and further entrench the systemic impunity enjoyed by Israeli forces and officials for unlawfully killing Palestinians.\\n” The US bulldozer that , in 2003 killed Rachel Corrie , was sold to Israel through a Defence Department programme , and the Abu Akleh family has asked US officials to “ clarify the extent to which American funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israel , the largest recipient of US foreign a d since World War Two has , with no accountability , killed more than 10,000 Palestinians since the end of the Second Intifada in 2005 , at least 50 of them just this year .\\nNo matter how clearly the United Nations identifies and condemns Israel ’ s violations of international humanitarian law , US Government loyalty to the Zionist regime appears unconditional and impervious to truth and reason .\\nOn its official website , the US State Department proudly recalls that the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel ” and , while affirming “ Israel has no greater friend than the United States ” also declares that “ the unbreakable bond between our two countries has never been stronger.\\n” This loyalty to Israel advanced to a further extreme with the Trump Administration ’ s plan to move the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem .\\nIt wasn ’ t always quite so extreme .\\nIn 1953 , a statement by the US Secretary of State did express disapproval of Israel ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerusalem .\\nThe statement reminded the world that the US had twice requested Israel not to move its Foreign Ministry to Jerusalem , confirming also that the concern was shared with a number of other governments .\\nThe statement concluded : “ We have notified the Government of Israel that we do not intend to move our own Embassy to Jerusalem ” .\\nThe selfish military Occupation of Palestinian land is about population-control , domination and land-seizures .\\nThe ruthless intention is to make life unbearable for the Occupied population , in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s Zionist goals .\\nFor example , on 5 July , soon after their rehabilitation as an essential water source , Israeli forces destroyed water-supply pipelines around a spring , in Duma .\\nThis village has been suffering serious water shortages , as a result of Israeli control over all water resources in the Occupied Territories .\\nThe denial of the Palestinian right to sink new wells is of benefit to Israel because , just as with other restrictions , it forces Palestinians to buy water directly from Israel ‘ s Mekorot water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people drives Zionist strategic planning .\\nIn the 1970s , Israel began the imposition of what it calls ‘ firing zones ’ ( or , alternatively , ‘ closed military zones ’ ) into the Palestinian West Bank , for the purpose of population-control and seizure of land .\\nFiring Zone 918 was first defined as a war crime by the Israeli human rights organisation , B ’ Tselem .\\nDetails from a 1981 Israeli ministerial meeting have revealed that former Prime Minister , Ariel Sharon , proposed that Firing Zone 918 be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local Palestinians out of their homes .\\nThis particular example of Zionist racism denies residential security to over 1,300 Palestinians who face being forced out of their homes at any moment .\\nThe zone is the basis for eviction orders , which have been condemned by the UN as “ contrary to resolutions of the United Nations Security Council and international law ” .\\nThe New Zealand Palestine Solidarity Network and supporters are calling upon our Prime Minister , Jacinda Ardern and Minister of Foreign Affairs , Nanaia Mahuta , to demand Israel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nIn view of the UN ’ s condemnation of the evictions and New Zealand ’ s recently declared independent foreign policy , there should be no reason for our Prime Minister and MFAT not to end their silence .\\nWill our leaders speak out ?\\nOr will allegiance to ‘ traditional allies ’ and strategic great power interests prevail ?\\nThe United States would certainly welcome that !',\n",

       "  'content': 'It ’ s impossible to read any media outlet today without an academic report being discussed which points out the disparities in social and economic indicators between Māori and Pasifika on the one hand and Pākehā New Zealanders on the other .\\nThese reports don ’ t usually propose solutions but are appeals to the wider community to pay attention and develop plans to address what are seen as racial injustices .\\nThe latest such report is from the Auckland University of Technology and says the Covid pandemic has worsened labour market disparities between New Zealand European and Pasifika people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pasifika men earned on average 22.5 percent less than NZ European men when entering employment .\\nThe disparity increased by a further 2.4 percentage points during the pandemic .\\nIt also found that pre-Covid-19 , when compared NZ European women , Pasifika women were on average 0.4 percentage points less likely to exit unemployment .\\nBut during Covid-19 , the probability gap widened to 1 percentage point , meaning the pandemic deteriorated Pasifika women ’ s chances of entering employment by 0.6 percentage points .\\nLead author of the report , Dr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was important to tackle the gaps .\\n“ There must be as a first step awareness of what is going on .\\nBeing aware [ that ] there is this large gap between both populations and [ have ] the willingness to try to somehow address this gap .\\n“ The other [ reason ] why it ’ s so crucial is because it ’ s affecting young people , it can leave a long term scar on their career and make progression in the future harder.\\n” It was important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building pathways to higher occupations or have active labour market programmes for displaced workers , Plum said .\\nAUT professor and NZWRI director Gail Pacheco said while the labour market was generally robust during the pandemic , not everyone managed to benefit from it .\\n“ Covid-19 has amplified the prevalence of ethnic disparities in the workforce , but it did not create those disparities in the first place .\\nTherefore , policy needs to not only tackle recent Covid-related disruptions to the workforce but be long-term focused on addressing the entrenched disparities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research was commissioned by the Ministry of Business , Innovation and Employment This report didn ’ t cover Māori but we can be certain similar negative disparities from Covid will be present in the indigenous community .\\nSo why are all these negative disparities for Māori and Pasifika so prevalent across pretty much all social and economic indicators ?\\nThe answer is straightforward .\\nFor the most part it is because Māori and Pasifika are disproportionately represented in the working class and these negative statistics affect all working class New Zealanders .\\nThere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these are the ones we should grapple with .\\nFirstly why are Māori and Pasifika disproportionately represented in the working class and secondly why is the focus on “ closing the gaps ” rather than confronting the problems faced by everyone in the working class ?\\nThe first question as it relates to Māori is directly a result of colonisation – pushing Māori off their land and using racism ( ideas of European racial superiority ) to justify doing so .\\nThere are many layers to this but understanding colonisation is the key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( as they are today in the RSE worker scheme ) brought in from the 1960s to make up labour shortages in our factories and then faced state oppression to drive them out through the “ dawn raids ” etc when the economy declined .\\nIt was the demands of capitalist businesses that made these decisions undertaken by successive Labour and National governments ( the dawn raids started under Labour in the mid 1970s ) rather than any concern for the welfare of Pasifika people .\\nRacism was rife then as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us asking why is it that as a country we are happy to have the working class suffer to maintain the deep streams of unearned income for the 1 % ?\\nWorking class New Zealanders pay the highest proportion of

arrangements would be a precondition for any such coalition ’ s formation .\\nThe Māori Caucus of the Labour Party would demand it .\\nThe Greens would expect it .\\nAnd the support of Te Pāti Māori ( TPM ) could not be contemplated without it .\\nThese constitutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the electorate .\\nTheir necessity would be loudly proclaimed in the run-up to the election by TPM as a means of mobilising Māori voters generally , and energising young Māori voters in particular .\\nTPM ’ s most obvious electoral strategy would be seek all seven Māori seats , while freeing their supporters to cast a Party Vote for Labour by way of compensation .\\nShould TPM win all seven seats , but fail to win a commensurate share of the Party Vote , then the next Parliament would have an “ overhang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more difficult for the Right to secure a majority .\\nWould Labour consent to TPM ’ s strategy ?\\nAlmost certainly .\\nOn the issues of decolonisation and indigenisation the Labour Party Caucus has demonstrated a firmness of purpose not seen since its predecessor ’ s embrace of “ Rogernomics ” back in the 1980s .\\nIt was not unusual in the late-80s to hear Labour MPs declare that they would rather lose their seat than reverse their support for Roger Douglas ’ s radical economic reforms .\\nFaced with the option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the co-governance measures they believe it mandates , this present Labour Caucus ( with a handful of exceptions ) would almost certainly evince a similar determination to win through or leave Parliament altogether .\\nSuch a coalescence of the Left around te Tiriti and co-governance would , naturally , generate and equal and opposite reaction from the Right .\\nAny notion the National Party may have entertained of attempting to ride the Treaty-and-Co-Governance tiger would have to be jettisoned hastily .\\nChristopher Luxon would have no choice but to embrace Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own .\\nDavid Seymour ’ s plans for legislatively defining the meaning of the Treaty , and having the resulting law either ratified or rejected by referendum , would thus be presented as the rock-solid commitment of the National-Act coalition government-in-waiting .\\nFaced with the possibility of losing every centimetre of ground they had won since 1985 , Māori nationalists would make no bones about the consequences of a National-Act Government .\\nThe re-colonisation of Aotearoa would be resisted – by any means necessary .\\nNot to be outdone , White Supremacist groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to “ re-tribalise ” New Zealand society , by stripping its citizens of their democratic rights and property , would be met with armed resistance .\\nHow would the Forces of Order respond to such threats ?\\nTheir first move would likely be against the most ardent promoters of the decolonisation and indigenisation agenda .\\nSenior public servants , vice-chancellors and media editors would be “ invited ” to moderate their radical stance

atmosphere .\\nAt the same time “ the usual suspects ” of the activist Right and Left would be made the subjects of heightened surveillance .\\nAll forms of intelligence gathering would be utilised in an attempt to keep abreast of the White Supremacists ’ and Māori Nationalists ’ activities .\\nFrom the perspective of the Forces of Order , the best outcome of such a surveillance programme would be the uncovering of plans by both sides to launch a series of attacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including the assassination of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition .\\nIn these circumstances , the Forces of Order would be presented with the opportunity to persuade the leaders of the Centre-Left and the Centre-Right to dispense with their respective coalition partners and announce their intention to go into the election as a Grand Coalition for Peace , Unity and Democracy .\\nThe urgent necessity for such a dramatic solution could be demonstrated by a few suitably terrifying leaks to the most co-operative media outlets .\\nPoll data , real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ s overwhelming support for the Grand Coalition .\\nDissenting MPs from Labour and National could then be purged ruthlessly from their Party Lists .\\nAt the electorate level , the candidate from the party assessed as most likely to win would be given a clear run by their coalition partner .\\nWith the Grand Coalition parties

investors don ’ t have to pay the tax they must on share dividends .\\nHowever , investor and executive greed often lead to companies being financially weakened to the point that they can not meet the

Reagan got rid of the law in the neoliberal anti-tax revolution .\\nIn the US they have a tax on capital gains from share sales that eventually is meant to even up the tax paid between dividends and capital gains .\\nThis does not happen in New Zealand .\\nSkyCity was substantially weakened in terms of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was part of the reason they moved to make 1000 workers redundant virtually overnight and had to suspend payments to banks .\\nThe redundancies proved to be a huge error .\\nThey were done in haste and unlawfully in many respects .\\nThe union was able to make the company pay additional compensation for its members as a consequence .\\nBut the economy did not tank as much as expected and the company was faced with massive staff shortages as soon as business was resumed following the initial lockdowns .\\nExcessive rewarding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reason they have offered below-inflation pay rises two years running .\\nThey argued in bargaining that they had a cake of a certain size that they could share with us .\\nTheir initial offer was between 3.5 % for many positions and 14 % for one position they are desperately short of .\\nWe argued that was much to low and we needed a minimum of 7.3 % to match inflation .\\nThey came back with a minimum rise of a still pathetic 4 % but cut everyone ’ s increase above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it .\\nI argued in bargaining that I was sure SkyCity had done share buybacks which is a way of rewarding shareholders in an extraordinary manner .\\nSo the cake that needs sharing includes what they have been getting .\\nThe cake includes shareholder returns .\\nIt is a simple economic fact that wages can go up without price increases if shareholder returns are moderated to cope .\\nI did a quick google search when I got back to the office to confirm my suspicion and sure enough , there were share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nShare buybacks proceeded throughout the year and the Chief Executive sold $ 1.9 million worth within days of the company buying $ 50 million worth in August 2019 .\\nThe National Business Review on 2 September 2019 , reported that : SkyCity chief executive Graeme Stephens has sold $ 1.3 million of shares within days of the casino company resuming its on-market share buyback .\\nDetails of the share sale are in a market disclosure filed to the NZX late on Friday .\\nAccording to the disclosure , Stephens sold 325,000 shares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share pursuant to a personal debt reorganisation .\\nThe shares match the number of “ commencement shares ” issued to Stephens for free in November 2016 , which vested two years into his tenure .\\nThe shares had no performance targets .\\nOn August 19 SkyCity resumed its on-market share buyback programme begun in April , which had been on pause since

the three days to August 21 .\\nThe practice of corporate share buybacks has been correlated in some research to the prevalence of executive incentive schemes .\\nLast June US Securities & Exchange commissioner Robert Jackson gave a speech expressing concern about how buybacks were being used .\\n“ There is clear evidence a substantial number of corporate executives today use buybacks as a chance to cash out the shares of the company they received as executive pay , ” he said .\\n“ Executives often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-term strategy for the company , and they ’ re not always wrong .\\nBut if that ’ s the case , they should want to hold the stock over the long run , not cash it out once a buyback is announced .\\nIf corporate managers believe that buybacks are best for the company , its

       "  'content': 'WHAT HAPPENS WHEN people who don ’ t usually participate in elections decide to vote ?\\nThings turn weird – that ’ s what happens .\\nThis is because the people who don ’ t vote are very different from the people who do .\\nThe motivations relied upon by the pundits to explain the behaviour of habitual voters are not the motivations of non-voters .\\nThat ’ s why , when these folk cross the line separating the passivity of non-voting from the world of active political citizenship the results can be startling .\\nIt ’ s why political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work so hard to reach and motivate the people perennially dismissed and abandoned by the smug political campaigners of the mainstream .\\nThe Cummings and the Bannons know these marginalised individuals : the people that shit happens to ; the people who live in the shit ; are extraordinarily combustible .\\nStrike a match in the right place , at the right time , and – Kaboom !\\n– the “ deplorables ” explode into action .\\nIt is precisely the “ otherness ” of these non-participants that makes them so potent politically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : one in which exactly the same proportion of National , Labour , Act , Green and Te Pāti Māori voters simply stepped across the line separating non-voting from voting ; would make no appreciable difference in either the opinion polls or the polling booths .\\nIndeed , this is pretty much what happens when people step out of the “ Don ’ t Know ” category to express a clear preference .\\nThey tend to break the same way as those who have already disclosed their electoral choices .\\nBut non-voters : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and phone canvassers to fuck-off ; they are different .\\nNon-voters come in two flavours .\\nThere are those who never got into the habit of voting , and those who , for a whole host of reasons , got out of the habit .\\nThe habit of voting , like the habit of going to school , is a reflection of a settled family environment .\\nIn such households , all manner of social and economic connections serve to keep their inhabitants tethered to the local community and its values .\\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and alienated from the community and its concerns .\\nThe impact of politics on their daily lives being neither perceived nor explained , they do not care about elections – or vote in them .\\nThose who have gotten out of the habit of voting usually have a sad story to tell .\\nFor some reason , the ties that bound them to their community have been severed .\\nIt may have been the result of family disintegration , substance abuse , criminal offending and incarceration .\\nAlternatively , it could have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , homelessness and/or severe mental illness .\\nSomething happened to set these individuals on a downward spiral to economic privation and social isolation .\\nWhat had been citizens with rights , become invisible un-persons with nothing .\\nPolitics was for winners – not losers like themselves .\\nBreaking into the world of these non-voters isn ’ t easy .\\nSomehow , a political movement has to convince them that the vote they cast will produce a direct and positive impact on their lives .\\nNon-voter politics tends to be grounded in the not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voting , changes nothing .\\nTheir cynicism is encapsulated in pithy anarchic aphorisms : “ Don ’ t vote , governments always win ” , or , “ If voting changed anything , they ’ d make it illegal ” .\\nThe crucial thing to note about these aphorisms , however , is that they identify an enemy .\\n“ Governments.\\n” “ Them.\\n” For non-voters , politics is what the people with power do to you .\\nThe idea that politics could be about what you do to “ them ” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insight of Cummings and Bannon was that it is possible to persuade these non-voters to use their votes as weapons .\\nDeployed strategically , the right number of votes , cast in the right number of places , can make “ governments ” quail and cause “ them ” to weep .\\nSell non-voters that message and you will have given them a truly visceral reason to vote .\\nTheir unlooked-for participation can ruin the whole day of the Powers-That-Be – delivering a massive one-fingered salute to the whole , evil , vicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voting , they can say “ Fuck You !\\n” to the people in charge , and – lo – the people in charge will find themselves unexpectedly and irremediably fucked .\\nAs happened with Brexit .\\nAs happened with Trump .\\nSo , where would the Kiwi equivalents of Dominic Cummings and Steve Bannon go looking for estranged and alienated non-voters ?\\nWhat part of the New Zealand population is most likely to have been uprooted from family and community ?\\nWhich citizens are most likely to fall foul of the Police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\\nWhat sort of New Zealander is the most likely to end up in jail – and the least likely to vote ?\\nWho , if they used their votes as weapons , could strike a mortal blow against the status quo ?\\nThe urban Māori underclass – that ’ s who !\\nAnd who has the best chance of reaching the urban Māori underclass ?\\nTe Pāti Māori .\\nNot that Te Pāti Māori has its very own version of Cambridge Analytica to identify the angry and the alienated and bombard them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TPM just doesn ’ t have those kinds of resources .\\nWhat it does have , however , is its own place in the networks created to fight the Covid-19 pandemic .\\nThese networks led Māori service providers to places and people undetected and ignored by the state and its agencies .\\nMore importantly , they began the process of reconnection and tethering that allows political messages to be taken in , rather than simply thrown away .\\nAnd when these folk lifted up their heads , looking around through eyes brightened by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TPM was there with the promise that , this time , this special time , voting could make a difference .\\nAotearoa was changing .\\nPakeha – especially young Pakeha – were changing .\\nThe racism was still there , of course , heightened , it would seem , by the prospect of Labour , the Greens and TPM having the numbers to keep the changes coming .\\nBut TPM also told them the country had moved on from 2005 , from Don Brash and his “ Iwi versus Kiwi ” election billboards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can die in 17 years !\\nTo the bigots still breathing , however , the Māori non-voters could deliver a very special gift – one that would ruin the racists ’ whole day .\\nIn the spirit of the community that had discovered them in their time of need , and which they had rediscovered , Māori non-voters could step across the line that separates the un-person from the citizen .\\nBy casting a vote in the 2023 General Election , not only could they re-make themselves , they could re-make their country @',\n",

       "  'content': 'IT ALL SEEMS so long ago now , and , to be fair , in human terms , 48 years is a long time .\\nNew Zealand was a different country in 1974 .\\nSomeone unafraid of courting controversy might say it had achieved “ Peak Pakeha ” .\\nAlthough the Labour Government of Norman Kirk had struck out boldly in the direction of a truly independent foreign policy : recognising “ Red China ” , and sending a New Zealand frigate to “ observe ” ( but really to protest ) the French nuclear testing at Mururoa Atoll , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” place .\\nIn the South Island , particularly , the two largest cities – Christchurch and Dunedin – had been built to look as though they were founded in the Middle Ages – not the mid-Nineteenth Century .\\nBorn and bred in the South Island , I had not been back there since 1969 , when the family moved to Heretaunga in the Hutt Valley .\\nBarely 18 , and in search of – well , I wasn ’ t quite sure – I boarded the Union Steamship Company ’ s inter-island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sailed south to Lyttleton .\\nYes , that ’ s right , Lyttleton .\\nForty-eight years ago it was still profitable to run a ferry service a wee bit further than Picton .\\nI ’ ve seen many beautiful places since that journey in 1974 , but none of them could match for sheer wonder sailing up Lyttleton Harbour on a brisk Autumn morning as the sun came up behind the Rangatira ’ s stern and bathed the hills and houses in a magical golden light .\\nMagical , yes , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what this essay is about .\\nThe magic of art and memory .\\nIt was on that journey south , in the autumn of 1974 , that I first encountered George Dunlop Leslie ’ s mysterious painting , “ In A Wizard ’ s Garden ” .\\nIt was hanging in the Robert McDougall Art Gallery , situated behind the Canterbury Museum in Christchurch ’ s splendid Botanic Gardens .\\nLeslie ’ s painting stopped me in my tracks .\\nThe room in which it hung was deathly quiet , I was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt myself drawn to it like Edmund and Lucy in C.S .\\nLewis ’ s “ Voyage of the Dawn Treader ” .\\nThe melancholic gaze of the young woman , the painting ’ s principal subject , held me spellbound .\\nWho was she ?\\nWhere was she ?\\nAnd who was the dark figure entering through the garden ’ s narrow gate ?\\nI can ’ t remember registering the artist ’ s name .\\nIf I did , then I soon forgot it .\\nBut the painting itself , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menace – that I did not forget .\\nPassing through Christchurch many times in the latter half of the 1970s , I always made my way to that quiet room , and to the half-sad , half-challenging gaze of the young woman in the garden , and to the dark figure who kept her there .\\nUntil the day came when I entered the quiet room and found the painting had been replaced by another .\\nNot unusual , of course , for art galleries to rotate the works in their collections , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s work had become a kind of talisman , a corporeal reminder of a time in my life when magic seemed very close .\\nIt ’ s removal struck me as both a judgement and an instruction : time to put away childish things .\\nBut , the child in me preferred Leonard Cohen ’ s poetry : Magic is afoot It can not come to harm It rests in an empty palm It spawns in an empty mind But Magic is no instrument Magic is the end And so the years passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I changed with it .\\nMagic seemed very far away indeed in the narrower and more materialistic nation we had become .\\nIf I thought of the painting at all , it was only as a symbol of what had been lost .\\nOur culture had become much less European and much more global in its focus .\\nThis was thought to be a good thing .\\nA better thing , though , was the indigenous culture of the Māori , unfurling from the cracks in the colonisers ’ concrete , and shimmering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then , just a few weeks ago , I saw it .\\nNo more than a tiny circle of colour beside Lynda Clark ’ s Twitter handle , but the human brain is a marvellous thing and mine instantly recognised the sad figure of the young woman in the red dress .\\nNot hesitating for a moment , I messaged Lynda and shared with her my longstanding fascination with the image she had chosen .\\nTurns out I wasn ’ t the only person enchanted by Leslie ’ s painting : Lynda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could , transfixed , like me , by the young woman ’ s gaze .\\nIt was Lynda who supplied me with the artists name and the painting ’ s title .\\n( I had thought it was called “ The Magician ’ s Garden ” – which was close , but not close enough for Google Images ! )\\nWith the correct details , the Internet flooded me with images and information .\\nAccording to the Christchurch Art Gallery : “ In response to the adverse impacts and uncertainties of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edwardian British artists were drawn to somewhat escapist historical or literary themes .\\nLavishly displaying this tendency , George Dunlop Leslie ’ s In the Wizard ’ s Garden was first shown at the Royal Academy in 1904 , and in New Zealand at the 1906–07 Christchurch International Exhibition .\\nBecause the painting puzzled visitors , Leslie was asked for an explanation of its meaning .\\nIts unhappy subject was a young medieval noblewoman who had sought an alchemist or wizard ’ s guidance to discover the secrets of the future .\\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ s ‘ Rappacini ’ s Daughter ’ , a macabre tale featuring a garden filled with poisonous plants .\\nThe setting of the painting was , however , English rather than Italian : it is known to be based on Leslie ’ s own garden in Wallingford , Oxfordshire .\\nLondon-based , former Dunedin merchant Wolf Harris , a friend of many leading artists , bought the work almost as soon as it arrived in Christchurch and then gifted it to the Canterbury Society of Arts.\\n” The secrets of the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff of wizardry .\\nFor me , however , the joy of being able to look again into the wizard ’ s garden served only to unlock memories of the past .\\nLike the works of those Victorian and Edwardian artists among whom Leslie ’ s skills shone so brightly , the New Zealand of 1974 strikes me now as an elaborate lie , designed to protect its Pakeha inhabitants from the “ impacts and uncertainties ” of their inescapably Pacific destiny .\\nThe Christchurch I arrived in that autumn morning is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly moving tectonic plates upon which Aotearoa does its best to stand upright .\\n“ God is alive , magic is afoot ” , wrote Leonard Cohen .\\n“ It moves from hand to hand ” .\\nAnd it is moving now .\\nPerhaps , in her half-sad , half-challenging way , the young woman in the wizard ’ s garden is urging us to step , finally , beyond its enchanted walls , and discover who , and where , we really are .',\n",

Lee , an MP I hold in rather high regard and who made a demonstrably positive contribution to our country in a dire time … had prior convictions for theft , liquor-smuggling , and breaking and entering .\\nHe did a year in Mt Eden , and I don ’ t mean as a constituency MP .\\nNow , all of that got ‘ overwritten ’ by his subsequent backstory .\\nHe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Force during World War One , and came back a wounded war-hero .\\nBlood – rightly or wrongly – does seem to wash out all sorts of other stains .\\nSlightly closer to contemporary times , we have Metiria Turei .\\nNow , it ’ s difficult to escape the fact that she did , indeed , commit both benefit fraud and , curiously , electoral fraud .\\nIn 1993 , for the latter , and in the Nineties for the former .\\nPersonally , I think the main thing she was actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgement .\\nAt least , in 2017 – twenty four years , just under a quarter of a century , after the thing which probably sank her .\\nBut this is all supposition for another time .\\nLest I be misconstrued ( and pilloried in the comments-section ) – I absolutely am not seeking to make the case that Sam Uffindell is some sort of latter-day Metiria Turei , nor the second coming of John A. Lee .\\nI also fully acknowledge that every so often an MP with a ‘ background ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ malevolence … or the sheer bathos … of the circumstance in question means they ’ ve fairly little choice but to resign .\\nDavid Garrett would be the obvious emblematic exemplar for the latter .\\nYou just … can ’ t quite take seriously an MP ( or the party which empowers them to speak for it ) who makes a personal cause célèbre out of ‘ tough on law and order ’ and removing judicial discretion particularly for for violent offending – only to then turn out to have a rather … @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case is , however , instructive in another way .\\nThere was a man who went through the system and benefitted from notable leniency following his apparent effort to emulate a fictional hitman and steal the identity of a deceased infant .\\nIf he ’ d internalized the lesson , and come out and up and then out again into politics advocating for a more ‘ nuanced ’ approach at the pointy-end of the judiciary , things might have played out differently .\\nAs somebody pointed out on Twitter yesterday evening – that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , found galling about the current Uffindell scenario .\\nNamely , that Uffindell had , quite clearly , benefitted from not being in receipt of a heavy-handed approach to his youthful assault of a younger kid .\\nAnd yet had gone and joined a party that ’ s often promoted itself as being ‘ tough ’ on youth offending .\\nAll up , I think that ’ s basically it .\\nWhen it comes to a situation like this , we – the voting public ( on or off twitter ) – are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and foremost , ‘ authenticity ’ .\\nThat ’ s a general rule and a given for politics .\\nHence the antiquated saying apt for the context – that once you can fake authenticity , you ’ ve got it made .\\nAnd second ( and heavily interrelated with the aforementioned ) – something to have happened in response to the putative offending conduct in question .\\nThat probably means demonstrable personal growth so you can say you aren ’ t the same guy who did X , along with actually taking ownership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ s actions and making appropriate effort to make things right with the victim / society at large / probably not just God .\\n( I mention that last one due to the American political set-piece wherein pretty much exactly that form of ‘ repentance ’ of the ‘ performative ’ and barely-even-self-flagellating variety all too often seem something of a one-stop-shop for certain ne ’ er-do-wells caught-out whilst seeking office ) Having things happen a lot further in the past definitely helps with all of that .\\nFar easier to proclaim you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades rather than a number of months and sound serious whilst doing so .\\nAll of this brings us to Uffindell .\\nI think there ’ s probably a general awareness – and a certain amount of grudgingly-tolerant leeway – out there in the Kiwi electorate that some people may do stupid , morally reprehensible things when they ’ re younger and at an all-boys boarding school .\\nAnd , much more overtly to the point – that twenty two years is plenty of time to grow and become a better man .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the corollary to that is that the onus is decidedly on National ’ s newest MP to demonstrate that he has in fact done so .\\nWhich is where , I suspect , Uffindell is going to come rather unstuck .\\nWith an intriguing new spin on the ancient political maxim – “ it ’ s not the crime that gets you … it ’ s the cover-up ” .\\nOr , in his case , and with deference to the rather recent timing of his calling up his victim to apologize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime that gets you … it ’ s the thing that makes the ethics look entirely performative ” .\\n‘ Authenticity ’ , remember ?\\nHence , he manages to go from his victim reportedly receiving the apology with a sentiment along the lines of ( to quote Stuff ’ s reporting ) : “ he would never forgive the boy who hurt him , but forgave the man Uffindell had become.\\n” … through to , once it became apparent just what Uffindell was intending on getting up to shortly thereafter : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sat down to watch the news on the couch with a beer and there he was , running for Parliament , ” the victim said .\\n“ I felt sick.\\n” [ … ] “ But seeing that – it made me feel his apology wasn ’ t genuine , he was just doing it to get his skeletons out of the closet , so he could have a political career.\\n” The thing that gets me about these skeletal-scandals is that they often seem to blow up far bigger , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a public figure than anything they may have done ( or are intending to do ) that ’ s more contemporary .\\nThat doesn ’ t sit right with me .\\nIf we ’ re going to dislike anybody , it should be the Nat MP in 2022 for things he ’ s doing in 2022 ( or thereabouts , plus or minus a year or two maybe ) Not some idiot 16 year old that ’ s now 22 years in the past and doesn ’ t actually wield political power .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this current scandal ought have no bearing upon that matter of public perception .\\nQuite the contrary .\\nEven leaving aside whether a teenage boy ’ s actions considerably betray the character of the man in later life … it can fairly be argued that not making amends earlier ( indeed , until shortly before going for National Candidacy selection ) doesn ’ t speak well to his character , ethics , and judgement as the older man .\\nUltimately , of course , none ( or , at least , very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We can ’ t answer honestly what might ( or might not ) have been going through his head – either on a reportedly near-daily basis over the preceding years , or as he made the decision to front up to his victim as and when he did .\\nPersonally , and without intending to proffer this as either the definitive truth nor something innately defensible , I suppose I can see how a man might be significantly guilt-wracked by his previous conduct to the point that he has a genuinely hard time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for a span of years and then decades .\\nMaybe .\\nI ’ m not saying that to try and turn Uffindell into the victim , here , by any stretch of the imagination .\\nI dare say that any queasy feeling Uffindell might have had about looking to engage with his victim should prove soundly eclipsed via many orders of magnitude by those emotions his victim has had to grapple with both over that same period of time , and in imminent anticipation of being contacted by his former tormentor .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guy ’ s face on a billboard or the 6 o ’ clock news as some sort of purported bright shining hope .\\n( ‘ Bright , Shining Hope ’ being a rather relative measure – and in the context of National ’ s current concepts of ‘ adequacy ’ , I mean … ) It is not , perhaps , beyond the bounds of possibility that Uffindell actually was reasonably genuine with his apology – and was also , correspondingly , rather breathtakingly tone-deaf with how it would look to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later commence inserting himself into the public eye as a political aspirant .\\nCertainly , I don ’ t think anybody is going to be losing money swiftly by betting against National and various of its MPs proving to be remarkably short-sighted , lacking in strategic cogency , or that simple dimension otherwise known succinctly as ‘ E.Q.\\n’ .\\nWe can probably demonstrate the inherent truth of that by considering just how many MPs or would-have-been-MPs the National Party has ( nearly ) fielded over the past two years despite the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out ahead of issues or actively filtering for undesirables … being aware of various of these guys ’ occasionally rather bizarre ( or , if you prefer , Bezzant ) shortcomings and still deciding to wave them on through to candidacy anyway .\\nThat is to say – the National Party does not appear to have been positively selecting for perspicacity with either its party or parliamentary office-holders for awhile now .\\nAlthough , in fairness – and yes , even in that most unforgiving of arms of our civic judiciary , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least some scope for a ‘ duty of fairness ’ to yet prevail – that ‘ lack of perspicacity ’ and/or ‘ sense ’ can cut both ways .\\nUffindell ’ s apology appears to have occurred in July of last year .\\nThat ’ s probably just under eleven months prior to his election in June ’ s Tauranga by-election .\\nHe almost certainly didn ’ t plan for it to happen that way .\\nAfter all , circa June last year , Tauranga ’ s MP was still one Simon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be anticipating sticking around for the foreseeable so as to be able to snatch back leadership of the National Party when Collins seemingly-inevitably imploded .\\nThere was no sign a by-election was to ensue .\\nWhich doesn ’ t mean that Uffindell didn ’ t have a candidacy in mind mid-way through last year – it just may have been mid-late 2023 that he was thinking of , rather than mid-way through 2022 .\\nDoes that change things ?\\nI don ’ t know .\\nI ’ m not sure anybody really does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s rather immaterial , now , isn ’ t it .\\nThings happened as they have , and we ( or , more likely , the Parliamentary National Party ) have to work out what now to do to move forward from it ( or through it ) in earnest .\\nSpeaking of which – short of National deciding to do something rather unexpected and somehow keel-haul/waka-jump/whatever a freshly-minted MP out of a job in a safe-seat just won on by-election … unless Uffindell himself resigns ( which should surely result in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat ) , there ’ s precious little to be done about the fact that said MP is now part of our public life .\\nThe only thing that the mass majority of us can really do in this situation is hope that said MP hasn ’ t just learned the lesson of the 16 year old boy , but also the lesson of the truly adult man .\\nWhich is one not of Comms , but rather of Values .\\nAnd spends the rest of his time in public life working very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us they ’ re better , but to actually be better ; and , one hopes , somehow make a positive forward-proofing difference in exactly the area they came unstuck in in the first place .\\nNow how they do that , of course … well , I don ’ t know .\\nBut he better be thinking hard in earnest .\\nBecause like it or not – as of yesterday evening , he went from having one victim who felt manipulated and misled through to having the best part of the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him .\\nI guess we ’ ll just have to wait and see whether he ’ s better at convincing us that he ’ s a changed and genuinely penitent man than he was the gentleman whom he sought to convince of all of this the first time around .',\n",

       "  'content': 'GREEN MP TEANAU TUIONO hopes to introduce a Private Members Bill repealing the Citizenship [ Western Samoa ] Act 1982 .\\nThe Act , introduced by the National Government of Rob Muldoon , and supported by the Labour Leader of the Opposition , Bill Rowling , prevented Samoans born between 1924 and 1949 from exercising the rights of New Zealand citizenship .\\nHad the legislation not been passed , the decision of the Privy Council ( then New Zealand ’ s highest court ) affirming the New Zealand citizenship of all Samoans born when New Zealand exercised a League of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a United Nations “ trusteeship ” ) over Samoa , would have stood , and tens-of-thousands of Samoans would have enjoyed free entry to New Zealand .\\nYet to be drawn out of the Private Members Bill “ lottery ” , Tuiono ’ s proposed legislation would presumably restore the citizenship rights of Samoans born between 1924 and 1949 .\\nObviously , this would encompass a much smaller group of people than was the case in 1982 .\\nSamoans born in 1949 would today be 73 years old – coincidentally the average life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much the same way as the formal New Zealand Government apology for the notorious “ Dawn Raids ” of 1974-76 , Tuiono ’ s PMB would stand as a marker of both condemnation and regret for the racist policies inflicted upon Pasifika by the New Zealand state .\\nGiven that any legislation would , after 40 years , be almost entirely symbolic – i.e .\\nonly a handful of Samoans would be in a position to take advantage of their restored New Zealand citizenship – the Greens stand to lose very little by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nSlightly more challenging for the Greens ’ would be the following counterfactual .\\nLet us suppose that Tuiono ’ s bill passes , and citizenship is restored to Samoans born between 1924 and 1949 .\\nThen , let us further suppose , that a new legal case is brought , and that the New Zealand Supreme Court ultimately determines that the Samoan descendants of the New Zealand citizens born between 1924 and 1949 are New Zealand citizens .\\nSuddenly the number of people affected by Tuiono ’ s legislation jumps from hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Samoa ’ s population of roughly 200,000 .\\nIn these circumstances , the Greens would be faced with the same political dilemma as Labour ’ s Bill Rowling in 1982 .\\nShould they uphold the law and welcome 200,000 new citizens to Aotearoa-New Zealand , or , should they bow to a deafening racist clamour to close the country ’ s borders to what would be , in effect , an entire Pacific nation ?\\nBack in 1982 , Rowling chose the second option .\\nHe calculated that Labour would sustain much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its lot with National , passing the legislation quashing the Privy Council ’ s judgement with all possible speed , and simply living with the loud moral objections of their Pasifika supporters and the increasingly vociferous anti-racist movements of the time .\\nAlong with , it must be said , the loud objections of Labour ’ s own youth wing , whose president , Sean Fleigner , released a statement bitterly critical of his own party ’ s capitulation to the undisguised racism of Pakeha New Zealand .\\nFor this gutsy demonstration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow Dunedin radicals received a “ visit ” from the party ’ s dynamic young president , Jim Anderton , who , no doubt acting on Rowling ’ s instructions , warned them against any further gestures of public defiance which , in addition to being unsupported by all but a handful of party members , and therefore doomed to fail – were bloody embarrassing to the Leader .\\nYoung New Zealanders in 2022 might be appalled at Labour ’ s open collaboration with the “ racist ” Rob Muldoon depicted in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nThe very same Rob Muldoon who had been willing to set New Zealander against New Zealander by refusing to ban the Springbok Rugby team from touring New Zealand in July-August 1981 .\\nBut , what seems outrageous with the benefit of 40 years hindsight , almost always struck the people living at the time quite differently .\\nThe Privy Council ’ s bombshell decision had been handed down in September 1982 – barely twelve months after the civil strife that so shocked and dismayed New Zealanders the previous year .\\nIn a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determination to avoid any further lockdowns and just “ live with ” Covid-19 , the Kiwis of 40 years ago wanted no more unpleasantness about racism , and were keen to put all the violent passions of 1981 behind them .\\nVery few voters would have thanked Bill Rowling and Labour for dying in a ditch over the Citizenship [ Western Samoa ] Bill – and expecting them to do the same .\\nLabour ’ s concern for what was in the minds of its ( overwhelmingly Pakeha ) supporters was no less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set in motion the policies that would culminate in Muldoon ’ s draconian Dawn Raids of 1976 .\\nKirk and his government were acutely aware of how deeply unpopular his decision to ban the scheduled 1973 tour of the Springboks was among Labour voters .\\nWhile the Commonwealth Games held in Christchurch in January-February 1974 had given his government an enormous boost ( which wouldn ’ t have been the case if the Springboks ’ tour had gone ahead ) Kirk was anxious to reaffirm Labour ’ s attachment to his country ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immigration policy .\\nWith the economy faltering , and mass unemployment threatening , sending the “ Islanders ” home appealed to his government as the least electorally damaging option .\\nDifficult though it may be to accept , such openly racist policy-making enjoyed solid bi-partisan support .\\nFollowing Kirk ’ s death in August 1974 , the anti-Pasifika feeling only intensified .\\nIndeed , between September 1974 and November 1975 , when Muldoon ’ s National Party decisively defeated the Labour Government , New Zealand shifted sharply to the right .\\nOver the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected – and was treated to – some of the most retrograde and vicious policy-making in New Zealand ’ s political history .\\nThe Dawn Raids were just one aspect of White New Zealand ’ s backlash .\\nWatching The Panthers television series , one could be forgiven for thinking that the Polynesian Panthers played a critical role in the Dawn Raids drama .\\nThe truth is they were never more than a minor irritant to the authorities .\\nIn spite of their name , they experienced nothing like the level of repression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States – most of whose leaders were either murdered by the Police and the FBI , or incarcerated for lengthy periods .\\nThe Panthers ’ obsessive focus on Muldoon , unhelpfully obscures the fact that most New Zealanders were more than happy to limit Pasifika immigration .\\nPolitically , the Dawn Raids offered the public dramatic proof that “ The Government ” was “ doing something ” .\\nHaving demonstrated the requisite “ hard line ” , Muldoon quietly wound the theatrics down .\\nBy 1977 it was all over .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greens to the test of an historical counterfactual : to see whether they fully appreciate just how deeply racism remains embedded in the Pakeha population .\\nSocially liberal New Zealanders have either forgotten , or been given the wrong information , about their country ’ s recent past .\\nMuch has changed since the mid-1970s and early 1980s – but an awful lot has remained the same .\\nIt ’ s easy to say “ sorry ” when your apology can be made without political cost , and in the absence of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resentments and prejudices it might inflame .\\nThe important thing to remember about Rob Muldoon , and the racist policies with which his name is associated , is that he drew his power from the hundreds-of-thousands of anxious and angry people who voted for him .\\nThat , after all , was his most famous slogan : “ New Zealand the way want it .\\n”',\n",

       "  'content': 'Last week , as New Zealand ’ s Medicinal Cannabis Scheme was labelled “ unworkable ” and the Ministry of Health finally confirmed a review of the scheme was imminent , I did two things that illustrated what is working and what isn ’ t : I obtained a prescription for cannabis bud ( imported from overseas ) ; and I destroyed a pile of cannabis grown here but unable to be given to patients .\\nOn the one hand , the Medicinal Cannabis Scheme allows any doctor to prescribe medicinal cannabis products to any patient , for any reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the NZ Ministry of Health , around 42 % of cannabis consumers use it therapeutically at least some of the time , which is around one-in-twenty people , and the most common reasons are for pain , sleep and relaxation or anxiety .\\nIf you use cannabis medicinally at least some of the time , for these or any other reason , then you too can get a prescription .\\nBut affordability is still an issue , with cannabis medicines unfunded and our rules imposing additional costs and forcing up prices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products .\\nMany local growers and producers are bleeding cash while they secure all the necessary approvals to get anything to patients , here or overseas .\\nOthers have destroyed crops after investing huge sums of money only to find they can not meet our stringent rules .\\nThere is hope .\\nOur scheme could still be world-leading .\\nThis review could fix the bits that aren ’ t working , if Ministers give it their focus .\\nFor that , we need to demand change , as we have done so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social justice and equity .\\nIn the meantime , you might want to get a prescription , just in case .\\nThe prescription is simple , if you can afford the products Patients often tell me their doctor is wary to prescribe cannabis , usually because of a lack of training and experience and also because following decades of prohibition there is still a lack of clinical research for many conditions .\\nIf your doctor is not up to it , there are now specialist cannabis doctors around the country which anyone can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nI spoke with Dr Mark Hotu at Green Doctors in Auckland .\\nOthers include Cannabis Care , Cannabis Clinic , CannaPlus+ , Cannabis Doctor and The Pain Clinic .\\nFor me , the consultation was straightforward enough .\\nFollowing a questionnaire for pre-screening and a conversation you ’ d typically expect with any medical professional , my new prescription allows me to legally possess and use the prescribed medicinal cannabis flower .\\nThat prescription also provides a legal defence when driving , if used in accordance with doctors instructions .\\nIt would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tests in favour of workplace policies that actually detect impairment , and maintain the jobs of patients who work and use medicinal cannabis .\\nAfter a very slow start , six varieties of imported flower are now approved , with more on the way .\\nThe only catch , and this is a big one , is that it can be expensive : sometimes two to three times the cost of illicit cannabis – which itself is often too expensive for patients to afford .\\nThat ’ s why an estimated 94 % @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still using illicit cannabis instead of getting a prescription .\\nWe need more affordable cannabis , in forms which patients actually want .\\nPrices are tending down though , with the latest product – a medium-strength THC flower from Canada called Shiskaberry – now on par with illicit market prices .\\nOther approved bud include Kikuya Dune and Arroyo , ANTG Eve , Mariposa , Rocky and Solace .\\nThe distributors can ’ t tell you that though , because medicinal cannabis products are still considered ‘ unconsented ’ and so can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to pharmacies being not knowing market prices , so it pays to shop around when getting your prescription filled .\\nOnly the Kikuya strains have officially made the grade for vaporising .\\nThe other products would be good enough anywhere else , but here in Nu Zild they can only be officially used as tea .\\nThe Ministry of Health provides instructions for how to make cannabis tea , with the helpful suggestion to add a sachet of coffee creamer to prevent “ the active ingredients in the tea from sticking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after cooling ” .\\nBut it ’ s all a bit nudge nudge wink wink .\\nThis looks pretty good for most patients , especially in light of the cannabis referendum not passing .\\nAnyone can get a cannabis prescription for something like , say , helping them sleep .\\nThey can then get legal cannabis from their doctor , a clinic or their local pharmacy .\\nBut only if they can afford it .\\nCost remains a big issue for many patients – especially if you ’ re in pain or have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , their condition affects their ability to work , and therefore to pay for any cannabis medicines .\\nFor them it has been a long road since the 2017 election when Labour promised to legalise medicinal cannabis within 100 days .\\nAs well as being prescribed cannabis , last week I also destroyed over a kilogram of high grade medicinal cannabis flower .\\nI had grown it at Auckland University of Technology .\\nMy licensed company Zeacann obtained the first cultivation licence issued under the new Scheme and proceeded to grow imported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some local illicit strains including Te Kakariki and Te Puke Thunder .\\nBut the facility at AUT was not up to the regulations .\\nIt is a PC2 bio-containment facility at a University , but that ’ s still not enough to pass the specifications for microbes .\\nWe grew some mighty fine cannabis , tested it and researched it , but had to destroy the remaining stocks .\\nI waited until the last moment , hoping something might change , but that perfectly good cannabis was carted off with the medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facility at AUT is now shuttered , replaced by filing cabinets .\\nI ’ m hearing from industry sources that a lot of this is going on .\\nWhere have all the crops gone that we ’ ve seen in media coverage ?\\nThere have been no exports , by anyone , of these perishable crops .\\nPeter Theil ’ s Tilray no longer dominates local sales , but there are still no locally made products on the market .\\nHelius rebottles imported oil .\\nRua is using Australian bud from Cann Group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of kilos of cannabis , worth millions of dollars , has been destroyed so far .\\nThat is a crying shame .\\nWe ’ ve been here before So while there is a great prescription process , the products are too expensive and are taking too long to be approved .\\nAnd although producers have huge potential on paper and in their press releases , many are struggling because the onerous requirements imposed by the scheme either make production impossible or have raised their costs beyond what is competitive and what patients already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week the Ministry of Health said it is reviewing the scheme after receiving inquiries and comments from the industry , and it will release a consultation document later this month .\\nIf that sounds familiar , last August the Ministry also said it was reviewing parts of the medical cannabis industry regulations , as growers and businesses said they would go bust waiting for approval to sell products .\\n“ The Ministry is aware that there are a number of issues with interpretation and workability of parts of the Misuse of Drugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is reviewing some parts with a view to whether the regulations are working in line with their intent , ” a spokesperson told Stuff at the time .\\nIn the same article I was quoted saying “ The opportunities are there for smart players and people with a bit of patience.\\n” But we need to make the scheme better , so patients can get local , affordable , products before the industry collapses .\\nOn the Daily Blog I wrote that medical cannabis needs a supermarket-style intervention .\\nI think the solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ s thinking for supermarkets to the medicinal cannabis sector , with five changes that could make it better for the 200,000 Kiwis whose lives have been transformed by using medicinal cannabis .\\nThe first suggestion was to allow herbal , over the counter products so patients can access more affordable herbal products and providers can more easily get stuff to market .\\nCurrent rules favour high cost pharmaceutical products .\\nThat ’ s fine , but let ’ s have farmer ’ s markets too , and hemp-based CBD over the counter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hemp should theoretically already be legal , like in the USA .\\nLet ’ s stop blocking what is now normal in other countries .\\nOn my recent visit to Europe , I found in every country CBD products like drinks , balms and flowers were sold over the counter .\\nCBD is widely available from pharmacies and cafes in the UK .\\nSecondly , let patients import or grow their own .\\nNormally , if a patient can not fulfil a prescription locally they legally have a “ reasonable excuse ” to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , the medical cannabis scheme blocks patients from doing the same with cannabis medicines .\\nPatients should be able to fulfil their prescriptions offshore instead of hoping for more products to appear here one day .\\nLikewise , if there are no suitable products available , patients should be able to provide for themselves .\\nNext , take a leaf from the Commerce Commission and break up the verticals .\\nLet ’ s follow the many examples overseas and not allow manufacturers to also grow .\\nThis would give craft growers a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and avoid monopolisation of the cannabis industry .\\nOtherwise re-legalised cannabis can have a diversity problem , with old rich men running the show .\\nAllowing pharmacy compounding would reduce prices , increase options for patients while giving local growers an outlet for their produce .\\nPharmaceutical manufacturing facilities take time and millions of

NZ ’ s medical cannabis rules require GMP manufacture and $ 15,410 product assessments – which are not required for compounding anything else .\\nWhile these suggestions would all be game changers ,

settings .\\nNew Zealand regulators , perhaps inadvertently , adopted several positions that are not harmonised with other countries , but are said to be the toughest in the world .\\nThe Minimum Quality Standard is set out in Part 1 of the Medicinal Cannabis Regulations ( 2019 ) .\\nBut for microbes it merely points to the European Pharmacopoeia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5.1.4 and 5.1.8 ” ) .\\nThis in

everyone else went with the higher level , we got the toughest setting .\\nIt turns out this can only be met with irradiation , which further limits options for imported products .\\nBut exporters are

imports , or forces additional testing on them .\\nThe levels for heavy metals are also not harmonised with Europe , meaning few of their products qualify , or they must again do additional testing to get here .\\nNew Zealand also requires more stability and shelf life testing than other countries require .\\nThe effect has again been to prevent cheaper imports from coming into NZ while also blocking exports which local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to bring down prices for locals .\\nThe end effect is less choice for consumers , more expensive prices , and growers destroying crops and struggling to stay afloat .\\nProperly harmonising our interpretations and settings with Europe would help usher in a suite of new and more affordable products for patients , and allow growers and manufacturers to more easily access overseas markets so they can grow , employ people here and bring down prices .\\nBut if we really want to disrupt the current situation , we should allow over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , treat CBD as a supplement or food not a prescription medicine , let patients grow their own , make the big end of town outsource their cultivation to small farmers , and allow pharmacy compounding .\\nThe

       "  'content': 'Inflation is back worldwide and with it is the blame game .\\nSo what is the truth behind the claims and counter claims that are being made .\\nAn impending worldwide recession in late 2019 , foreshadowed by a freeze in the US repo markets , led to US Federal Reserve to embark on a major amount of money printing .\\nInterest rates were pushed down to free up credit .\\nIn early 2022 , world production and trade were then disrupted further by economic closedowns that were imposed as public health measures to combat the health impacts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks across the globe and government budget deficits were massively expanded to cope .\\nInterest rates were driven below zero in some cases .\\nPeople were actually being paid to borrow money – imagine that .\\nThe monopolies that dominate global production and trade also seized whatever opportunities of genuine or manipulated shortages that existed to impose price gouging wherever they could .\\nThe profits of energy companies for example simply exploded as a consequence .\\nMost central banks , including the Reserve Bank of New Zealand , ignored the growing inflation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disruption for the price increases .\\nRightwing economic and political voices schooled in the “ monetarist schools ” of thought which say inflation is always a monetary phenomenon , stayed silent .\\nThey sensed that their system had dodged the bullet of a broader economic collapse .\\nThe extraordinary explosion in the asset wealth of the ruling class globally that kicked in over late 2020 and through 2021 , was also a factor in muting criticism , I ’ m sure , as well .\\nBut the monetarists were in charge of economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US Federal Reserve started the process of money printing , dubbed “ Quantitative Easing ” for the first time around to get out of the deepest crisis of world capitalism since the 1930s Great Depression .\\nThey had ignored their theories to save their system .\\nIt had seemed to work that time without triggering broader inflation than in their own assets so maybe it would work this time as well .\\nBut today we have inflation averaging 9-10 % over much of the globe .\\nThese are numbers not seen for decades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have inflation rates of 60-80 percent .\\nThere is now a risk that the continuation of current policies will unleash hyperinflation of the US dollar in particular , which will destroy its value and end its role as the dominant world currency .\\nFrom the point of view of the 1 % owners of the world ’ s wealth , that is something that must be prevented at all costs .\\nHyperinflation was threatened once before in the late 1970s when US inflation hit 13 % and there was a flight from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a few months in late 1979 .\\nThis required what was dubbed the “ Volker Shock ” in the name of the then US Federal Reserve Director Paul Volker who stopped monetary expansion and restored confidence in the dollar by pushing the Fed ’ s official cash rate up to 20 % Government spending on welfare and education was also targeted for cuts .\\n“ Austerity budgets ” became the norm .\\nAiming for a budget surplus became economic orthodoxy across the major capitalist nations although this was only achieved temporarily in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanent wars of empire across the globe .\\nAfter the inflationary 1970s in New Zealand we had our own version of the Volker Shock under the new Labour Government elected in 1984 and the official cash rate reached an all-time high in 1985 of 18 % .\\nVariable mortgage rates hit 20 % .\\nOf course capitalists who were in the business of lending money rather than producing goods were massively advantaged by high interest rates .\\nThere is no reason to open a business unless the profit rate is above the cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origin of financialisation and de-industrialisation in the advanced capitalist countries as literally General Electric became GE Capital .\\nThe one percent don ’ t care how they make their money .\\nBut accumulated wealth needs to be stored in both financial and non-financial assets .\\nHistorically this was broadly a 50/50 share but a gap has opened in favour of financial assets since 2008 .\\nThe 1 % hate inflation with a passion as it reduces their financial asset values by that percentage or more .\\nWorking people also get angry at price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect their living standards .\\nAnd , in normal circumstances , central banks will move to raise interest rates and slow the economy to stop it .\\nThis will , at least temporarily , hurt profits and sharemarket prices as a result .\\nBut in 2008 and 2020 central banks tried to keep the economy from contracting further than it already had ( in 2008 ) or was expected to do ( in 2020 ) by printing money through what is known as “ Quantitative Easing ” .\\nIn 2008 this did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recession had already hit hard so the money was hoarded by the 1 % or used to settle debts among themselves , rather than used to boost spending more broadly .\\nBut the latest round of quantitative easing involved both central bank money printing and government budget deficits to save the system .\\nThe money was also given to ordinary people to spend .\\nInflation was inevitable .\\nI warned of this fact in a 2019 article headed The coming economic crisis , “ unorthodox ” monetary policy , and Donald Trump .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ determine central bank and government policies on these matters and the war on inflation will be declared absolutely essential for a nation ’ s economic survival .\\nFor the rightwing politicians and their economic “ thinkers ” dubbed monetarist economists , the fault lies with too much government spending and too much central bank money printing and they are correct without fully understanding why .\\nThe question they need to be asked is why they stayed silent when it was happening .\\nIn the 1970s the principal means of creating money and fuelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The US also needed to do this to finance the war in Vietnam .\\nThe economic orthodoxy at that time became known as Keynesianism after the UK economist John Maynard Keynes .\\nKeynes was an upper-class , classical , pro-capitalist , free-market economist but accepted something must be wrong with the classical view when the economic depression that couldn ’ t happen under those theories did happen in the 1930s .\\nHe came to the view that the economy may need the assistance of lower interest rates from central banks or a budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employment .\\nRobert Muldoon in New Zealand , Prime Minister and Minister of Finance from 1975 to 1984 and US President Richard Nixon ( 1969-1974 ) were public supporters of Keynesian policies despite their right-wing politics .\\nKeynes , also , was not a friend of workers .\\nHe thought the cure for inflation was to cut wages through wage controls .\\nHowever , in the period after World War Two budget deficits became endemic .\\nThe end result was dubbed “ Stagflation ” a combination of inflation and economic stagnation .\\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working people because wages are being cut by inflation while our ability to resist is being undermined by high unemployment .\\nThat is why socialists don ’ t favour Keynesian policies over monetarist polices .\\nIt ’ s the capitalist system and its inevitable crises that is the problem not the policies designed to manage the crises .\\nThe Keynesians were removed from operational control and replaced by adherents of the Monetarist school .\\nThe principal theorists of monetarism were from the Chicago School of Economics lead by Milton Friedman .\\nAs well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were also radical free-market dogmatists who favoured austerity for workers , free trade in goods , free movement for capital , free interest rates and the privatisation of everything , including education and health care .\\nThey also support eliminating the minimum wage and unions because these “ interfere with the market ” .\\nThe Act Party in New Zealand is an adherent of this school .\\nWith monetarists in charge , budget deficit financing was sharply curtailed – especially on spending that assisted working people – like welfare , health and education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Banks like New Zealand were made “ independent ’ with the exclusive goal of targeting inflation to keep it low .\\nMoney supply was to be controlled through interest rate increases each time the economy started growing a little and unemployment began falling .\\nConveniently for the right wing political leaders , their theories are also deeply anti-working class .\\nThe Chicago Boys were invited to Chile to transform the economy in favour of the rich under the military dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet after he seized power from a socialist-minded government in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Magazine report from January 12 , 2016 , headed “ The Boys Who Got to Remake the Economy explains the policies of the people put in charge of the economy : Their program centered on reductions to fiscal spending to solve high inflation and economic difficulties .\\nThey opened the economy to foreign imports , privatized dozens of state companies , and removed most government controls on private economic activity .\\nAt the same time , as it was opening up the Chilean economy , the regime was clamping down on political opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years in power , thousands of people were killed or “ disappeared.\\n” But while it came under heavy human rights criticism , Chile was the first country to apply Friedman ’ s economic principles , and , years later , the famous economist called this process , lead by his disciples , “ the Miracle of Chile.\\n” Friedman himself visited Chile and met with Pinochet in 1975 , where he praised the economic measures taken by the Chicago Boys and Pinochet ’ s government .\\nThe connection with the dictator has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Friedman ’ s legacy in the United States .\\nThe UK followed Chile ’ s policies under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 1979 , the US under President Ronald Reagan in 1981 and New Zealand in 1984 led by a Labour Party government Finance Minister and future Act Party leader , Roger Douglas .\\nThese policies were dubbed “ neoliberalism ” to mark them out from the previous Keynesianism .\\nIt was , of course , theoretically possible for a government to stop the budget deficits and fight their inflationary impact by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nNo capitalist government from that time tried to do that , of course .\\nAdherents of monetarism and its free-market dogmas were put in charge of every aspect of government policy .\\nFor example , that is why the economists at the New Zealand government agency responsible for the labour market policies – the Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment – predict every year that the proposed rise in the minimum wage will lead to more unemployment , when the opposite has happened year after year .\\nThe monetary side of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2008 crisis hit .\\nThis was considered necessary to stop a system-wide collapse of the banking and financial in the US and Europe in particular .\\nAll forms of debt debt exploded across the globe but this was seen as the price of the rescue of the private profit seeking system .\\nBut then the recovery of world capitalism following that was the slowest in the history of capitalism .\\nIt was becoming clear that the world was gearing up for a renewed slowdown in late 2019 and then the pandemic hit .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ new doses to money printing and government spending to save their system .\\nCapitalists only produce if the can sell goods for a profit .\\nThey only lend money if the feel they will get their money back with interest .\\nEssentially the state in almost every country in the world has stepped in to protect those profits whenever they got threatened .\\nA central bank can create money by simply printing it electronically .\\nWhat that gets used for , however , is something that can be different in different periods .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis they used the money to buy up bonds from distressed banks and industrial corporates to prevent them going under .\\nIn New Zealand $ 28 billion was given virtually free to the banks to lend directly to whoever they wanted .\\nThey gave most of it to property speculators who drove up prices by 30 % in one year .\\nAnother $ 100 billion was made available to the government to use to prop up businesses during the pandemic .\\nThis allows the government to run big budget deficits without horrendous interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capitalists for the bonds they issue to finance the debt .\\nThis is “ unorthodox ” by any measure but considered necessary by everyone as the crisis hit .\\nThe return to orthodoxy means the central bank must retire the bonds that it has created by buying them back and needs to push up interest rates to do so .\\nBut , in the absence of taxes on wealth , the budget deficits are also being targeted because they are also a way of creating spending artificially – a form of money creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money directly .\\nThis will inevitably induce a recession in New Zealand over the next year or so .\\nThis is true also for Europe and the US and therefore the whole globe .\\nThe cost of the rescue of the capitalist profit seeking system will now be unloaded on working people because the crisis that is coming has been made that much bigger and more dangerous by the escalating debt levels .\\nWorld capitalism got out of the 2008 and 2020 crisis with massive debt creation .\\nAs a result , US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nIn the EU , the average debt-to-GDP ratio was 88 % at the end of 2021 .\\nAlthough the EU ’ s founding Maastricht Treaty provides for a maximum of 60 % , many countries are well above the 100 % of GDP level , as the table below shows .\\nThe US public debt is the most important indicator of this process , because of the weight of the US economy .\\nFrom about 60 % of GDP before the 2007 crisis , it exceeded 130 % after the 2020 recession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the International Monetary Fund , “ Global debt [ public and private ] rose by 28 percentage points , to 256 percent of GDP , in 2020 [ i.e.\\n, in the course of one year ] … The global public debt ratio jumped to a record 99 percent of global GDP.\\n” Global debt is now 256 % of global GDP .\\nAt the end of World War Two after the massive borrowing to pay for the war in was around 100 % .\\nIt remained around that level until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a break in terms of fiscal policy , this avalanche of debt , coupled with rising interest rates , will definitely push a number of economies towards default .\\nThis applies to some heavily indebted rich countries like Greece and Italy but will savage many poor countries .\\nThe debt problem is not only affecting states but corporations also .\\nMorgan Stanley calculates that 16 % of US firms are “ zombies ” ( highly indebted companies that are hanging by a thread ) .\\nBloomberg reports that zombie company debts total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a US phenomenon .\\nZombies account for more than 20 % of Europe ’ s companies according to DW .\\nHigh-interest rates ( meaning the end of the “ cheap money ” era ) will make it much more difficult for these companies to re-finance their debts , and this can lead to defaults – which in turn means mass layoffs of workers .\\nIn fact , they are being hit by a double whammy of war-induced shortages and price rises for basic food , fertiliser and other commodities .\\nThis will accentuate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising against most others in the world because there is a flight of capital to the safety of the world ’ s biggest and safest financial market .\\nThis means the poor countries ’ debt which is usually in US dollars is getting more and more unpayable .\\nAs Oxfam notes in a new analysis , during the pandemic ’ s second year ( from March 2021 to March 2022 ) , the IMF approved 23 loans to 22 countries in the Global South – all of which either encouraged or required austerity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced that the global economy is entering a major slowdown , downgrading the growth prospects of 143 countries .\\nAt the same time , inflation rates have reached historic levels .\\nAround the world , hundreds of millions of people are falling into poverty , particularly in the Global South .\\nOxfam has sounded the alarm that we are ‘ witnessing the most profound collapse of humanity into extreme poverty and suffering in memory ’ .\\nDavid Beasley , the director of the UN World Food Programme describes the situation in the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis , we were facing an unprecedented global food crisis … Then , we thought it couldn ’ t get any worse , but this war has been devastating.\\n” “ …the number of people suffering from ‘ chronic hunger ’ had risen from 650 million to 810 million in the past five years… the number of people experiencing ‘ shock hunger ’ had increased from 80 million to 325 million over the same period .\\nThey are classified as living in crisis levels of food insecurity , a term he described as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ t know where your next meal is coming from ’ … “ … after the economic crash of 2007-09 , riots and other unrest erupted in 48 countries around the world as commodity prices and inflation rose… The economic factors we have today are much worse than those we saw 15 years ago , ” If the crisis was not addressed , he said , it would result in : “ It is a very , very frightening time .\\nWe are facing hell on earth if we do not respond immediately.\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ solutions for the crisis these nations face is more free market and privatisation policies .\\nThis is what is now being imposed on the bankrupt Sri Lanka as the price of a bail out from bankruptcy .\\nIt is the price the Zelenksy regime in Ukraine has agreed to pay for Nato support against Russia .\\nIn this blog I haven ’ t addressed the climate crisis .\\nThis is now being compounded because the capitalist crises and imperialist wars are driving up the production of planet destroying energy sources .\\nCapitalists have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planet is doomed if we continue business as usual .\\nWe need a programme of solutions that transcend the world we live in .\\nThe only future is a future that puts people and the planet , not profits first .\\nThere is no other solution available to humanity but socialism where we can own and democratically control the major means of production and plan for a future that allows humanity to survive .',\n",

       "  'content': 'GAURAV SHARMA has clearly had enough of parliamentary life .\\nEqually clearly , he is not suited to it .\\nNevertheless , he has made an extremely useful contribution to the bullying debate .\\nHis op-ed piece for the NZ Herald confirms what all political journalists should know : that Parliament is Ground Zero for institutionalised bullying .\\nIt would , however , be naïve to expect members of the Press Gallery to augment Sharma ’ s observations with their own .\\nThe Press Gallery is no less enmeshed in the system of punishments and rewards that pervades every corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves .\\nWhat emerges from the Gallery and the Labour Party itself over the next few days promises to be a master-class in the art of dismissing , diminishing and disparaging an individual who has had the temerity to breach the iron law of Omerta which governs the practice of party politics .\\nLike Fight Club , the first rule of party politics is not to talk about party politics .\\nIt is to be hoped that Sharma is a resilient person , because the amount of emotional violence heading his way will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be a vain one , however , since Sharma appears to have entered Parliament without the necessary acculturation in the vicious political environment of the New Zealand Labour Party .\\nPurely from the perspective of an outsider , Sharma ’ s selection appears to have been a pro-forma affair .\\nVery few Labour strategists would have anticipated success in the Hamilton seats – which , prior to 2020 , had been in National ’ s column for four elections in a row .\\nSharma would likely have seen himself as nothing more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Party Vote .\\nA not unreasonable view , given his Number 63 position on Labour ’ s Party List .\\nJust as it did for most Hamiltonians , Sharma ’ s victory in Hamilton West must have come as a mighty shock .\\nNothing like as big a shock , however , as the political culture of the Labour Caucus .\\nThose Labour politicians who spent years fighting their way into Parliament would have an enormous advantage over a political naïf like Sharma .\\nThey would know what to expect .\\nWhose way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to block .\\nAnd , whose hunting party to join when the Leader ’ s minions identified a member of caucus to be taken down a peg or two .\\nAll of them would have mastered the courtier ’ s art of sucking-up and punching-down .\\nPutting it bluntly , a disturbingly high proportion of Sharma ’ s colleagues would be – as he has now charged – bullies .\\nThose who weren ’ t bullies would ’ ve been doormats .\\nSelected as candidates for their placidity and biddability , they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relied upon to back their party right or wrong , and to support whoever occupies the top leadership roles with an equally undiscerning fervour .\\nThe traditional term for these types is “ hack ” .\\nSharma likely found these Labour lambs even more disturbing than Labour ’ s wolves .\\nJudging from his op-ed piece , Sharma may even have been labouring under the misapprehension that he was in Parliament to represent the electors of Hamilton West .\\nHe may even have thought that they were the people to whom he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wrong !\\nThat is merely his constitutional role .\\nHis real role is to shut up and do as the Whips command .\\nMake a speech on a subject about which he knows nothing .\\nSit on a Select Committee and vote exactly as the Chair indicates – no matter how wrong or stupid .\\nMost importantly , say nothing , write nothing , and do nothing that attracts unwanted attention .\\nThe poor man would soon have discovered that this “ sit still and shut up ” rule applied with equal force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incautious enough to stand up in front of his colleagues and express views contrary to those of the Front Bench , then he would have very soon have appreciated why those tasked with the responsibility of keeping the Back Bench under control are called “ Whips ” .\\nThink about it for a moment .\\nLabour has a caucus of 65 MPs .\\nMost of them , like Sharma himself , highly qualified professionals .\\nHow , then , is it possible that all but two of these intelligent and ( presumably ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being Louisa Wall and , now , Sharma ) have never even once spoken out of turn or ( God forbid ! )\\nexpressed a viewpoint on any major – or even minor – issue that was not in 100 percent conformity with the official party line ?\\nWhat does it take to inspire and maintain that sort of collective discipline ?\\nThe answer , tragically , is fear .\\nFear of being written-off as a troublemaker ; and fear of the emotional violence inevitably inflicted upon those who , at least initially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who long ago abandoned all resistance .\\nThe good little bunnies of the Labour caucus will , of course , object that party politics can not function without party discipline .\\nThey will remind their critics that politics has always been “ the art of the possible ” , and that nothing will ever get done if a government is mired in endless internal debates .\\nThese objections will be backed-up energetically by the Press Gallery as basic common-sense .\\nHow could they not , when the members of the Press Gallery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ Stockholm Syndrome ” as the MPs they cover .\\nGallery journalists are expected by their editors to hunt as a pack – not on their own .\\nThey are also prone to being bullied by the darker variety of ministerial minion , who will threaten them with a denial of access to the key newsmakers if they step too far out of line .\\nHow many of the current crop of Labour MPs and Gallery journalists are aware of the fact that the First Labour Government ’ s caucus was a hotbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above over-ruling the demands of Cabinet Ministers ?\\nStrangely , given the dictates of “ common sense ” , that First Labour Government still managed to keep its promises to the electors – and transform a nation .\\nWhich is not to say that the party was lacking in bullies , merely that , back then , there was no shortage of Labour MPs willing to stand up to them .\\nSharma , sadly , is not doing that .\\nHe has clearly had enough of Parliament and is more than ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional .\\nWhat he has been willing to do , however , is draw aside the curtain , if only for a moment , and let the electors of New Zealand see how their representatives are treated .\\nThose same electors owe him a vote of thanks : not only for the glimpse of the bullying culture that pervades their Parliament , but also for the demonstration that is bound to follow of how that same , sick , system responds to its critics .\\nUndoubtedly , there will be Labour supporters reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fury .\\nIt is fitting , then , to close with a vivid illustration of Labour ’ s long-standing culture of bullying .\\nAt the Labour Conference of 2002 , a tiny handful of mostly younger delegates attempted to protest the Labour-led Government ’ s decision to send troops to Afghanistan .\\nAs Helen Clark began speaking , one young man rose to his feet and attempted to make his opposition known .\\nAs he did so , a number of party heavyweights ( fortuitously seated next to him ) also rose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ – none too gently – and physically dragged from the auditorium .\\nTwo young women , positioned closer to the stage , who attempted to unfurl an anti-war banner , received very similar treatment .\\nWhen Willie Jackson boasts that Labour has a different definition of democracy – he isn ’ t kidding .',\n",

       "  'content': 'THE SEVENTIES had come to an end with Western Leftism in a thoroughly confused state .\\nActually Existing Socialism still held sway over most of the Eurasian continent .\\nAdmittedly , the Chinese variant bore less and less resemblance to the original Soviet model , which had rounded off the Seventies by invading Afghanistan .\\nIt was , however , extremely hard to like either of the Communist behemoths .\\nOf the French revolutionary credo : Liberty , Equality , Fraternity ; the actually existing socialists had mastered only Equality .\\nAlthough Cuba and the recently liberated Portuguese colonies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steady progress towards Fraternity .\\nFor Western Leftists , Actually Existing Socialism ’ s evident failure to promote Liberty proved to be a deal-breaker .\\nAfter all , what had the Sixties and Seventies been about – if not Freedom ?\\nThe anarchist firebrand , Emma Goldman , had written to Lenin in 1917 : “ If you make a revolution , and there ’ s no dancing , then I ’ m not coming.\\n” The New Left felt exactly the same about Freedom .\\nWhen Actually Existing Socialism finally embraced Liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to keep the Western Left away , until then … But , if class-based revolutionary politics found itself becalmed , the so-called “ New Social Movements ” movements arising out of the struggle for Black civil rights in the USA and South Africa , feminism ’ s second wave , and the energetic pursuit of gay and lesbian liberation , had storm-force winds in their sails .\\nAs the Eighties dawned , it was almost impossible to engage in left-wing politics without acknowledging these new emancipatory movements , or avoid incorporating their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolutionary praxis .\\nPredictably , the New Social Movement ’ s hardest sell was to that part of the Left which still clung to the ideas of Karl Marx .\\nIt wasn ’ t that the Marxists were incapable of recognising the oppression of Blacks , women and gays , merely that they regarded the struggle of these subordinate groups as mere skirmishes within the overarching and all-important battle between Capital and Labour .\\nClass consciousness was the “ Open Sesame !\\n” to the free and abundant world that socialism would make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the struggle against it had to be the same .\\nUnity – not Identity – was the watchword .\\nThe fighters for racial , sexual and gender equality were having none of it .\\nThey would not be subsumed in the “ world historical struggle ” whose ideological generals all seemed to be straight , white , and male .\\nIf the personal was political , then these unconscious beneficiaries of white supremacy and patriarchy had some serious shit to work through .\\nEnter the Tripod Theory .\\nAccording to its promoters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one great struggle between capitalists and proletarians was a mistake .\\nExploitation wasn ’ t purely a question of economics , it was a vast , multi-faceted collection of struggles in which racism and sexism featured hugely .\\nFar more could be achieved , they argued , by recognising the co-equal status of race , gender and class in the “ triple oppression ” of humanity .\\nEach of these buttresses of oppression depended on and was upheld by the other two .\\nPatriarchy provided capitalism with an already elaborate framework of sexually-charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made possible the vast accumulation of slave-generated wealth that set the capitalist system in motion .\\nRace and gender thus raised profound cultural issues that could never be accommodated comfortably in the narrow economism of class politics .\\nThe Tripod Theory gave rise to another metaphor , one in which the Left , by embracing the concept of the “ three oppressions ” , constructs a fighting platform upon which Blacks , Women , Workers and Gays can fight white supremacy , patriarchy , homophobia and capitalism side by side – each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gender and class thus become the three legs of the Left ’ s footstool , distributing the revolutionary load equally .\\nIn an attempt to draw the separate struggles of the traditional socialist Left and the New Social Movements into a useful theoretical and political dialogue , Rob Stevens , a progressive academic based at the University of Canterbury , bravely launched the journal Race Gender Class in 1985 .\\nIt ran for 14 issues and ceased publication in 1995 .\\nGlancing through the issue released in 1991 it very soon becomes clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had hoped the ideologies related to race , gender and class might , by virtue of being brought together on the pages of a single periodical , somehow give rise to a new and powerful revolutionary praxis , then they must have been disappointed .\\nNot even the tender ministrations of Bill Birch , Ruth Richardson and Jenny Shipley : which had , in that bitter year , 1991 , dramatically raised the Misery Index for unionised workers , solo mums and the whole beneficiary underclass ( in which Māori and Pasifika figured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fightback anticipated by the Tripod Theory .\\nAnd just in case any unreconstructed class warriors out there feel moved to lay the blame for this failure at the feet of the race and gender contingents of the broader emancipatory movement , it is worth recalling that it was the Council of Trade Unions which refused to call the general strike that would , undoubtedly , have brought together workers , women , people of colour , and gays on the one platform where real and durable alliances are formed – the barricades .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , is the dramatic progress made by those who elected to march under the colours of race and gender .\\nIt ’ s not just the familiar names of Jane Kelsey , Moana Jackson and Vincent O ’ Malley that catch the eye , but also that the issues they wrote about have such a contemporary feel .\\nThirty years ago , discussions about the implications of the Treaty “ partnership ” were confined to a tiny minority of senior public servants , academics and activists ( pretty much the readership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nThirty years later , the issues debated by the ideologues of race and gender in 1991 constitute the political agenda of the 2020s .\\nBut , if the Politics of Identity have thrived over the course of the past three decades , the Politics of Class have dwindled and faded .\\nWhich is not to say that the vast gulf separating the human-beings who keep the capitalist system running , and those who pocket the profits , has not widened since the days of the tragically optimistic Tripod Theory .\\nNor that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any way .\\nMerely that 1991 was also the year that the Soviet Union fell to pieces .\\nTurns out that the only thing keeping Western Leftism remotely credible was Actually Existing Socialism .\\nWith the reality of class-based politics removed – along with the Berlin Wall – the Politics of Identity , now on two legs , race and gender , was free to run away and join the capitalist circus .\\nWhat these identarians have yet to appreciate , however , is that Capitalism remains the ringmaster .\\nThirty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race and gender have become is the entertainment .',\n",

       "  'content': 'THERE ’ S A STORY I HEARD about Nikita Khrushchev and his famous speech to the Twentieth Party Congress in February 1956 .\\nThis was the speech in which he denounced Stalin ’ s crimes against the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and its long-suffering peoples .\\nAt the conclusion of the speech , and after the obligatory standing ovation , one of the delegates shouted out : “ Why didn ’ t you say all that when Stalin was alive !\\n” “ Who said that ?\\n” Khrushchev shouted back .\\nA deathly silence fell over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before smiling grimly and saying : “ That ’ s why.\\n” I recalled that story when I read the Editorial in today ’ s ( 18/8/22 ) NZ Herald .\\nAlluding to the Labour Caucus ’ decision to suspend Dr Gaurav Sharma , the leader-writer opined : “ The unanimity of the decision to suspend Sharma is significant too , as the Labour Caucus is a broad church of 65 MPs .\\nNone it seems , felt he merited another chance.\\n” It is difficult to conceive of a statement more revealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of those who presume to pass judgement on our nation ’ s politics are steeped .\\nWhat Labour MP in their right mind would have dared to vote against the Leader ’ s clear preference to eject Sharma from Caucus ?\\nHad a Cabinet Minister done so , it would have been interpreted as a direct thrust against the Prime Minister .\\nBackbenchers , having witnessed the emotional violence visited upon Sharma over the preceding days , would have raised a hand only if , like the Member for Hamilton West , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snake-pit .\\nIt might not be political ignorance , however , which prompts such fatuous commentary .\\nIt might be the news media ’ s shameful complicity in the Labour Party ’ s infamous proclivity to discipline and punish anyone who dares to draw people ’ s attention to the naked realities of power .\\nIt is nothing short of astonishing that the newspaper which published Sharma ’ s original op-ed critique was prepared , just a few days later , to assert that the very same dissident-crushing strategies he had complained of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display from the moment it appeared , were no more than could reasonably have been expected .\\nNone of us should be surprised at this “ suck-up , punch-down ” New Zealand character trait , it has been with us for most of our history .\\nBut , even though we know how New Zealanders in authority are going to react to even the slightest challenge , it still comes as a bitter disappointment to discover just how few friends dissidents have in this country .\\nThe sneer and the put-down are everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herald opted to suggest that Sharma more-or-less had it coming , RNZ ’ s afternoon host , Jesse Mulligan , spent 10 minutes talking to Dr Grant Morris of Victoria University of Wellington about the history of “ rogue ” MPs in New Zealand .\\nThough both participants in this discussion agreed that the expression “ rogue ” wasn ’ t very accurate , that did not prevent them from using the pejorative term throughout the broadcast segment .\\nBoth men agreed that the common thread running through the stories of MPs who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the policies of their party was less about principle than it was about ego .\\nIn justification of this thesis , Morris advanced the example of Herbert ( Bert ) Kyle , the National Party Member for Riccarton .\\nIn 1942 , Kyle had a falling out with the National leader , Sid Holland , resigned from the party ( before he was expelled ) and left Parliament altogether in 1943 .\\nBecause it has so much in common with Sharma ’ s complaints about Labour in 2022 , Kyle ’ s reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Party organization has built up a watertight compartment that makes one become a ‘ yes man ’ with expulsion as an alternative.\\n” What Morris neglected to say in his remarks about this little-known rebel , is that his charges against Holland were , almost certainly , true .\\nThe National Party ’ s second leader brought New Zealand as close as it has yet come to having a fascist in charge of a major party .\\nHolland had been a prominent member of the New Zealand Legion – a proto-fascist organisation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aftermath of the unemployment riots of 1932 .\\nIt was Holland who drafted the viciously authoritarian “ Emergency Regulations ” which effectively extinguished democracy in New Zealand for the duration of the 1951 Waterfront Dispute .\\nFar from being a egoist , the mild-mannered veterinarian-turned-politician , Bert Kyle , was a man of principle who recognised a dangerous bully when he saw one , and was unwilling to become a “ yes-man ” to a politician whose personal political ideology bore a disturbing resemblance to that of the Nazi warlord New Zealanders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nCloser study of these so-called “ rogue ” MPs will show that in a clear majority of cases it is a clutch of very similar concerns about the leadership , policies and administration of their respective parties that lies at the heart of their rebellions .\\nAs Jim Anderton ( whose example of “ roguishness ” Morris omitted entirely ) liked to say : “ I didn ’ t leave the Labour Party , the Labour Party left me.\\n” Jacinda Ardern is fortunate that her own rebel MP is more aggrieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employment issues than he is about its policies .\\nA left-wing politician worthy of the name , with a mind to rebel against the ideological positioning of Labour under its present leadership , could inflict enormous damage upon the Ardern Government .\\nNot that expressing concern at the behaviour Sharma calls “ bullying ” is in any way trivial .\\nIn a caucus where there is a disturbingly large number of MPs who subscribe to the political tactic of “ No Debate !\\n” ; alongside others eager to see “ Hate Speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent to jail for three years for expressing unpopular opinions ) passed at the earliest opportunity ; and still more who will brook no dissenting from Labour ’ s radical interpretation of te Tiriti o Waitangi ; the ability to bully and intimidate doubters would seem to be a necessary part of the modern Labour politician ’ s skill-set .\\nNot that the organs of “ official ” opinion are at all interested in lending their support to those foolish enough , or brave enough , to speak out on such matters .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ such individuals to validate the claims of the Powers-That-Be that we live in a free society .\\nBut , these “ out-speakers ” will never be given the resources they need to explain why we don ’ t .',\n",

       "  'content': 'The housing catastrophe ( Salvation Army description ) for tenants and families on low incomes has been thrown into sharp relief by the appalling statistics that more than 200 children are now living in cars because there are not enough state houses .\\nUnder the Labour government this number has gone from 51 at the end of 2017 , to 228 in June this year .\\nSimilarly , the number of people living in tents has also climbed from 21 at the end of 2017 to 84 in June this year .\\nWhen confronted with these shocking figures of families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of Labour governments the Prime Minister told TV1 News last night it was “ not acceptable for any family or individual to be living in a car which is why we ’ ve put so much effort into having built now over 10,000 public housing spaces , we ’ ve quadrupled the number of transitional homes , we ’ ve bought more public houses than anyone since the 1970s ” .\\n“ What you ’ re seeing in the data is we still have people who are coming to the Government to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our job to get them into permanent housing.\\n” Ardern said in 2017 there was not an accurate picture of people living in crisis .\\n“ At that time not everyone could receive the emergency housing special needs grant , not everyone could make it onto a public housing waitlist and not everyone was moving into permanent housing .\\nWe now have a situation where we have a much more accurate picture of the need that exists.\\n” Can you spot any red herrings there ?\\nHere are a few to start with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the last five years BUT it has demolished thousands in the process .\\n( In fact the government demolished more state houses than it built in six months of last year ! )\\nOverall there has been a net increase in state houses of only 5,556 between September 2017 – when Labour came to power – and March 2022 .\\nKainga Ora figures show So much for the 10,000 built in 5 years .\\n( Incidentally the first Labour government , faced with a housing crisis , built 10,000 houses per year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,110 extra state houses being provided each year by Labour ( 5,556 over five years ) is for a state house waiting list which has risen to a staggering 26,664 at June 2022 .\\nCheck out the graph .\\nThere were just over 5,000 on the state house waiting list when Labour came to power in late 2017 – now there are 26,664 !\\nAnd Labour is providing just an extra 1,110 per year .\\nOn this basis some desperate families will be waiting till 2048 to get a state house .\\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criteria for getting on to the state house waiting list has not changed since Labour came to government .\\nIt ’ s the same criteria as National used .\\nThe reason the government is demolishing so many state house each year is partly to replace houses that are past their use-by-date but more importantly it is so the government can sell vast swathes of land to private property developers and then use the proceeds to fund state house building rather than put up any money itself .\\nIn fact Labour is in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assets – crown land – since the 1980s .\\nThe country needs an industrial-scale state house building programme but Labour is selling crown land that could enable this and seems determined to keep state housing at just 3.6 % of total housing stock ( it was 5.4 % in 1990 ) And for those that might think all this ignores government support of the many small social housing providers , it doesn ’ t .\\nGovernment policy remains to provide just an extra 1600 IRRS ( Income-related Rental subsidies ) per year to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ – for a waiting list of close to 27,000 .\\nLabour just doesn ’ t care .\\nIf you think they do care about housing for those on low incomes – show me the evidence !\\nSo now the PM says that finally after five years of Labour “ We now have a situation where we have a much more accurate picture of the need that exists.\\n” And too sad for the children who will be sleeping in a car in your city tonight .',\n",

       "  'content': 'STEPHEN MINTO ’ S POST throws into sharp relief the utter collapse of ideological credibility within the New Zealand Greens .\\nThat the Greens could openly align themselves with private property developers , and facilitate the transfer of public wealth into the hands of capitalist entrepreneurs , is astonishing .\\nAbout the only upside to this extraordinary betrayal of everything Green politics stands for is that it proves conclusively that whatever this party ’ s MPs might call themselves , they are NOT Greens – and now everybody knows it .\\nThe question that stands in the most urgent need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this happen ?\\nIn fewer than 20 years , the New Zealand Greens have degenerated from a vibrant parliamentary party that commanded respect from even its staunchest ideological foes , to a collection of slogan-shouters who , when challenged , can not explain what their slogans mean , or why they are shouting them .\\nUnderstanding how political fashion was able to triumph over political coherence in the contemporary Green Party , is critical to rebuilding the eco-socialist movement this country so desperately needs to combat the effects of climate change .\\nA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nThe original Greens , the “ magnificent seven ” who ran up the steps of Parliament in 1999 , were Baby Boomers .\\nBetween them they represented just about all of the key political , social , and environmental movements that had defined progressive New Zealand politics between 1965-1985 .\\nWith one exception .\\nThe “ magnificent seven ” did not include a representative of the Māori struggle for tino rangatiratanga .\\nGreen Party politics , like the politics of the Values Party which preceded it , was a product of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coherence would not survive the impact of the Māori Renaissance and the re-birth of te Tiriti o Waitangi .\\nPoliticians who had won their spurs in the Peak Pakeha era were sufficiently ideologically grounded to ride the wild storms of Treaty politics .\\nThe Green Boomers adapted to the new cultural and political protocols of Māori nationalism , but they did not succumb to them .\\nThe same could not be said for the younger Greens .\\nRaised in an era of rising cultural uncertainties and conflicts , they lacked a solid place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less confident – ideologically , emotionally and spiritually – than their elders .\\nCompared to the rising generation of politically assertive Māori , the young Pakeha Greens were weak .\\nAnd weakness breeds resentment .\\nLike so many of those who were born after the Boomers , the younger Greens found themselves living in a world radically different from their parents ’ and grandparents ’ .\\nWith little or no personal memories of the New Zealand before neoliberalism , they found it easier to attribute their generational predicament : student loans , unaffordable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selfishness .\\nThe generation who had been given it all , had decided , cruelly , to keep it all .\\nSuch was the claim .\\nThat it was a middle-class-Pakeha delusion largely escaped the Boomers ’ young accusers .\\nA forgivable failure , given neoliberalism ’ s extraordinary success at rendering class oppression invisible .\\nThrow into this dangerous mental mix the guilty feelings of “ White Privilege ” heaped upon young progressive Pakeha activists , and it ’ s easy to grasp what made the Boomers such a tempting scapegoat .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Edwardian villas , with their bright cottage gardens , cosy firepits , and mature trees .\\nSo smug .\\nSo determined to keep their “ heritage ” neighbourhoods unsullied .\\nSo well-versed in the arcane arts of nimbyism .\\nAnd so many poor people ( their own kids included ! )\\nin need of warm , dry , affordable housing .\\nNot that the Boomers gave a damn – they had everything they needed .\\nNot for long !\\nYoung Green activists , working hand-in-glove with their progressive comrades in Central Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boomer bubbles of privilege .\\nLegislation would be passed that effectively made it impossible to say “ Not in my back-yard !\\n” The luckiest generation had run out of luck .\\nThe Boomers were about to discover what it feels like to be on the receiving end of unbridled state power .\\nAnd yet , as Minto so clearly points out , these young Green activists at the end of the generational alphabet have turned out to be as ignorant of capitalist economics as they are of capitalist politics .\\nArming oneself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state is no guarantee that what emerges from the planning process will be to the advantage of the poor .\\nFor the poor to benefit from state intervention , they must first attain direct influence over how , and on whose behalf , the state intervenes .\\nBut , what was true of the First Labour Government and its state-housing programme , is not true of Jacinda ’ s government of “ kindness ” .\\nThe poor have absolutely no control , and virtually no influence , over the modern Labour Party .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ be asking private property developers to build them affordable houses ?\\nIf they did , would we really have had the debacle of KiwiBuild ?\\nThe four guiding principles of the international Green movement : ecological wisdom , social justice , participatory democracy , nonviolence ; are there to prevent party organisations from arriving at the same arid destination as the parties of social-democracy .\\nHad the Greens been guided by considerations of social justice and participatory democracy they would have not looked up for the power they needed , they would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they would have recognised that cities , too , have their own ecologies , and that these are as worthy of conservation as forests and rivers .\\nThey most certainly would have recoiled from the prospect of relying upon the institutional violence of legal coercion to bulldoze a path to their objectives .\\nSadly , they weren ’ t guided by any of these principles .\\nSadder still , the decision of the Greens to throw in their lot with private property developers makes it clear that the poor have no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the modern Green Party than they do over the modern Labour Party .\\nIf they did , then the probability is high that they would have insisted on having a strong hands-on presence in the planning , design , and construction of affordable homes .\\nIt is equally likely that the whole exercise would not have been geared towards private profit , but to the fulfilment of proven public need .\\nIt is also a pretty safe bet that the Greens ’ housing programme would have amounted to something more than an elaborate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dad .',\n",

       "  'content': 'It is not often I disagree with John Minto ’ s analysis and commentary but I do with that in his recent article ‘ Prime Minister plays with red herrings while children sleep in cars ’ .\\nJohn ’ s article is unfair and somewhat inaccurate I believe .\\nIt is inaccurate because the Prime Minister ’ s claim , cited in John ’ s article , that in 2017 ‘ not everyone could receive the emergency housing special needs grant , not everyone could make it onto a public housing waitlist and not everyone was moving into permanent housing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and under the direction of then Minister of Social Development Paula Bennett , a homeless family or person could not simply apply for housing assistance from the state and have their need added to public housing waiting list .\\nInstead , they had to phone in and have their needs assessed over the phone to establish if they could even go into a Work and Income office to actually apply for assistance .\\nThis was the worst case of bureaucratic gate keeping I have ever seen .\\nI worked for the Salvation Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OIA request of the Ministry of Social Development to report the numbers of such calls it received seeking housing assistance .\\nRemarkably the Ministry didn ’ t record this information – such was the deliberate ignorance of the MSD bureaucrats .\\nThe best way to avoid having politically embarrassing data is simply not to collect it .\\nThis all changed with the election of the Labour led government in August 2017 .\\nWhile John is correct in his claim that ‘ the criteria for getting on to the state house waiting list has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ , the process for even getting to ask for help became a lot easier .\\nThis improved accessibility is the reason for the explosion in the public housing waiting at least until 2020 .\\nOver this period the waiting list grew from 6,180 households in December 2017 to 22.521 in December 2020 .\\nThe Labour government did not create the homelessness and unmet housing need we see now .\\nThis was created by successive governments not having the courage to tax wealth and choosing not to see public rental housing as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a residual in an otherwise private housing market .\\nWe have the housing system middle-class homeowners voted for .\\nThe present Government suffers from this same lack of courage and vision .\\nAfter nearly five years in office we should be seeing some turn in the housing crisis but we simply aren ’ t .\\nLower quartile rents have risen almost 40 % in the past five years while the value of the housing wealth for the 60 % of households which owns all the houses grew by $ 600 billion .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is difficult to know what is happening in terms of the stock of state housing and other social housing provided by so-called community housing organisations .\\nAs John says in his article the political spin only ever talks about the numbers of new state houses built and not the ones being demolished or sold off .\\nThe number of rental dwellings owned by Kainga Ora – the government ’ s housing agency , has grown by just 3000 since Labour came to power .\\nMeanwhile the Government is selling off state housing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what amounts to state sponsored gentrification .\\nThe Government is trying to address homelessness through its funding of emergency and transitional housing .\\nThe problem appears now that it is a transition to nowhere .\\nIn March 2020 the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development contracted to various NGOs to provide 3092 transitional housing places .\\nBy March 2022 this programme had grown to 5145 places .\\nThe 2022 Budget provided for spending of over $ 550 million for emergency and transition housing .\\nAmongst this was a budget of $ 31.5 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcomes in Rotorua for vulnerable families and whānau with children by contracting specific motels to provide emergency accommodation ’ .\\nThis budget is expected to assist 200 families meaning an average annual cost of $ 155,000 per family .\\nIt is churlish to suggest that the Labour Government is not taking homelessness seriously but it is spending more and more money on band aids while it waits for the Kainga Ora to get its act together and start building more houses than it demolishes .\\nThis turnaround may not be far away given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Auckland at least .\\nYet even when we get to 5,000 new state house builds a year , public housing will still remain a residual part of our housing system and taxpayers will still be paying $ 150,000 per year to house a homeless family in a shabby Rotorua motel .\\nWhat is more appalling than this prospect is the sure knowledge that a National led Government will do even less .',\n",

       "  'content': 'As I explained last week government policies that include the central banks directly printing money and the government running budget deficits are the central reason we have broad-based inflation in major advanced capitalist economies , including New Zealand .\\nBut under capitalism , it makes complete economic sense to run budget deficits in a counter-cyclical way moderate the impact of the business cycle going into a downturn .\\nThis is actually what the National Government did in 2008-13 and it is what the current Labour government has done in response to the Covid shutdowns in economic activity .\\nThe economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the responses by each government .\\nOur results suggest that over the five-year period 2008-13 , the GFC/earthquake crises saw a fiscal response in the form of an increase in net core Crown debt of an estimated $ 62 billion .\\nThis was the equivalent of 33 percent of GDP in the beginning ( 2008 ) year .\\nOver the five-year 2019-24 period , we estimate the fiscal response to be an estimated $ 142 billion increase in net core Crown debt .\\nThis is the equivalent of 47 percent of GDP in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While the absolute size of the fiscal responses is noticeably different ( $ 62 billion compared to $ 142 billion ) , its ratio to GDP provides a better reflection of the respective sizes of the two fiscal responses .\\nIn particular , 33 percent compared to 47 percent suggests the current administration and Treasury officials expect the COVID-19 recession to be less than one-and-a-half times that of the GFC/earthquake crises .\\nBut Berl does note the different ways the two governments did the fiscal response – National through tax cuts for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nThe fiscal response to the GFC/earthquake crises was dominated by a reduction in tax revenue equivalent to 20 percent of base-year GDP .\\nThat is , nearly two-thirds of the fiscal response comprised the Government taking in less tax than it would otherwise have taken .\\nThis response was the net result of combined income tax cuts and an increase in GST , alongside reduced economic activity .\\nOn the spending side of the fiscal response , increased government spending accounted for the equivalent of 15 percent of base-year GDP .\\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID-19 crisis is unambiguously led by Government spending .\\nThe projected increased government spending is the equivalent of 35 percent of base-year GDP .\\nThis accounts for more than three-quarters of the COVID-19 fiscal response .\\nHowever , there is only a seven percent ( of base-year GDP ) reduction in tax revenue , a result of reduced economic activity as there are no projected tax rate changes .\\nIn summary , the nature of the two fiscal responses unsurprisingly reflect the political hue of the administration of the day .\\nThe blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relative tax take , the red response prefers to lift the Government ’ s relative spending efforts .\\nI am a socialist who wants to end capitalism but I don ’ t want to see an economic collapse dues to simple mismanagement .\\nIt is technically possible to run government budgets with modest deficits , or big ones in a major downturn , without unleashing inflation if you are willing to tax the rich .\\nBut what annoys me is that the leaders of the Labour and national parties pretend they still pretend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running budget surpluses unless there is a big crisis .\\nIt is also extremely annoying that when a Labour government is running deficits and literally printing money they don ’ t prioritise the welfare and housing needs of the poorest in the country who rely on benefits to survive .\\nInstead the money has been given to businesses to save jobs .\\nThis was probably necessary but clawbacks could have been enabled if it wasn ’ t actually needed .\\nThe Reserve Bank also printed money but they then handed billions of dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property speculators .\\nThis was not necessary and drove up prices by 30 % in one year .\\nThis government of New Zealand has said it wants to go back to budget surpluses as soon as possible .\\nCurrently , they are predicting to do so in the 2024-25 fiscal year .\\nThis is economically illiterate .\\nIt is akin to a religious dogma rather than economic science .\\nThis is not economically necessary in New Zealand which has one of the lowest debt to GDP ratios of any advanced capitalist country .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ without increasing the debt to GDP ratio so long as the economy is growing .\\nGovernment surpluses have a negative impact on the economy by withdrawing money from circulation and contracting rather than expanding economic growth .\\nAlso , the deficit could be reduced from the current high levels by increasing taxation of wealth to supplement all the taxes workers currently pay but that is very unlikely in the foreseeable future .\\nThere are also two funds with $ 100 billion between them held by ACC and the Superannuation for future payments .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the massive infrastructure deficit the country currently has because they were created for ideological , not economic reasons .\\nACC used to be a pay-as-you-go system funded from current levies and taxation .\\nThe ACC fund was created by the 1990-99 National government to prepare it for privatisation .\\nThis requires an insurance-type fund to cover future claims .\\nThe privatisation was stopped by Labour in 2001 but they didn ’ t disestablish the fund so ACC retained the penny-pinching insurance model to deny entitlements .\\nWorking people were over-taxed to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided why that money couldn ’ t be returned or used for other purposes .\\nThe Super Fund was established in 2001 by the Labour Government Finance Minsiter Michael Cullen .\\nThe only reason I can see for it was to allow the ever bigger budget surpluses he was running to be hidden it away in a manner that couldn ’ t be accessed for normal spending .\\nInfrastructure spending was starved .\\nTo justify the decsison , a fictitious panic was promoted that National Super would become unaffordable and we need a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future expenditure .\\nNo government in the world thinks it is so incompetent that it can not prepare for the future by spending appropriately now on infrastucture to make the economy more productive to be able to increase the tax take in the future – especially if they could tax wealth and chose not to .\\nRefusing to tax wealth at all includes nearly all forms of capital gains in New Zealand .\\nThis encourages a huge weight being given to and taken up by the property market in the New Zealand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up 300 % since 2000 – an OECD record .\\nThe USA and OECD

gone from 2 times GDP to 4.8 times GDP in the same epriod .\\nThis compares to 1.7 times in the US .\\nThe Sharemarket is only worth 0.6 of GDP compared to 2.2 in US .\\nCurrent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has

       "  'content': 'THE ORIGINAL ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN for Nanaia Mahuta ’ s “ Three Waters ” project was surprisingly honest .\\nNot in terms of the information it communicated to the public , which was , at best , misleading ; and , at worst , shamefully propagandistic .\\nIn terms of what they wanted the public to believe , however , the promoters of Three Waters could not have been more transparent .\\nNew Zealand ’ s rivers and streams were awash with poo .\\nCouncils had failed their electors .\\nFixing up the water would be eye-wateringly expensive .\\nRadical remedies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these frightening propositions were true .\\nNew Zealand ’ s rivers and streams had come under increased pressure as the country ’ s dairy herd expanded rapidly in the first two decades of the Twenty-First Century .\\nThe solution to this problem , however , lay not with a radical restructuring of New Zealand ’ s drinking , waste and stormwater infrastructure , but in improving the livestock management of the nation ’ s diary-farmers .\\nAs is so often the case , New Zealand ’ s farmers rose to this challenge .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ planting helped to filter farm run-off .\\nNot that this has prevented the Government ’ s supporters from characterising New Zealand farms as open sewers .\\nSeemingly , ten million cows are only able to relieve themselves in bodies of running water .\\nWhat actually happens , of course , is that cows , like most mammals , defecate on what lies immediately beneath their rear ends .\\nFor the vast majority of this country ’ s 4.9 million cows ( the size of the New Zealand dairy herd has never exceeded 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies beneath their haunches are good , old-fashioned , New Zealand paddocks , which actually benefit from the breaking down of cow poo into top-soil .\\nDangerous nitrate run-off is as much an artificial fertiliser problem as it is a cow pee problem .\\nNone of these facts mattered .\\nNew Zealanders were supposed to believe that every time they quenched their thirst with a glass of water they were swallowing shit .\\nNot only that , but the task of fixing their drinking water was now beyond the financial resources of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local authorities ’ century-old-plus sewage and stormwater infrastructure was failing and in urgent need of repairs and/or replacements they could not afford .\\nThis “ the country can ’ t afford it ” catch-cry was critical to the shape of the Three Waters project .\\nNew Zealand ’ s neoliberal state ideology is violently allergic to the public-funding and ownership of critical infrastructure .\\nTreasury ’ s preference is to have local government bear the costs of renewal – either by raising rates , or borrowing .\\nUnfortunately , local government ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than have the New Zealand state stand in the market for the finance required to upgrade New Zealand ’ s drinking , waste and stormwater systems – which it could borrow at the most favourable interest rates – successive governments have been advised to create a new stand-alone entity , or entities , and have it/them borrow the needed money .\\nTo reassure the lenders that their returns are secure , those same advisers have made it crystal clear that said entities must be absolutely impervious to all forms of democratic interference .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ reassure voters that their councils still “ owned ” their three waters infrastructure , under no circumstances could local authorities be permitted to control it .\\nIt was precisely this separation of ownership from control ( control being central to the whole concept of ownership ) that caused the Auditor-General to present such a strong critique of the Three Waters project – as currently conceived .\\nBut , ownership and control are not only concepts crucial to the value and utility of tangible assets – private as well as public – they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tino rangatiratanga – Māori sovereignty .\\nIt is at the intersection of these two key concepts that the deepest and most difficult problems of Three Waters arise .\\nIwi authorities have seized upon the credit-rating agencies ’ insistence that the proposed Three Waters entities be sealed-off from democratic interference , to fashion a governance structure favourable to themselves , from which the Pakeha majority is excluded , and which enables Iwi to release revenue streams that the ( for once powerless ) Pakeha state can not dam .\\nA bold plan , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected their Pakeha compatriots to simply wave on through .\\nIndeed , it is difficult to conceive of any group other than the present collection of political actors who would have taken such risks to see the Three Waters project implemented .\\nLabour has the largest Māori caucus in its history , ably co-led by Nanaia Mahuta and Willie Jackson .\\nLabour itself commands an absolute majority in the House of Representatives and , like their Green ally , its leaders are ideologically committed to the judicially contrived and academically elaborated concepts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nWithout the staunchness of the Māori caucus , and the “ wokeness ” of Labour and Green MPs , Three Waters would never have got off the ground .\\nThere are those on the Left who argue that this fortuitous aggregation of Māori activists and allies is the direct result of Helen Clark ’ s legislative rejection of the Court of Appeal ’ s Foreshore & Seabed judgement back in 2004 .\\nThe three dominant players in the Sixth Labour Government : Jacinda Ardern , Grant Robertson and Chris Hipkins ; are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Clark Government ’ s unconscionable theft of the Foreshore & Seabed .\\nEighteen years later , at the summit of the Pakeha state , these three are determined to have no repeat of the racist travesty they were forced to live through in 2004 .\\nThis time , Labour will not let the Māori lose .\\nStirring stuff !\\nBut if the so-called “ Sharma Drama ” has taught us anything , it is that the political culture of the post-Rogernomics Labour Party simply does not produce politicians of such mettlesome quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely back in 2004 , Tariana Turia ’ s resignation from the Labour Party appeared to inspire the same cold fury as Gaurav Sharma ’ s “ treachery ” .\\nLoyalty trumps all other considerations in Labour : has done since the party split apart with such destructive acrimony in 1989 .\\nHad Ardern , Robertson and Hipkins felt the shame of 2004 as keenly as some on the Left suggest , they would have resigned alongside Turia and , like the fast disintegrating Alliance , done all they could to help her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nEqually untrue is the proposition that Labour ’ s inadvertent creation of the Māori Party kept it out of office for nine years .\\nAt no time did Māori MPs constitute the difference between a National and a Labour government .\\nBetween 2008 and 2014 Labour ’ s parliamentary numbers were so low that had all the Māori Party MPs defected to the Opposition , the National Government could have continued to govern with the support of Act .\\nThe durability of the Three Waters Project is not the product of Labour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crown-Iwi collaboration and compromise .\\nEighteen years of hard academic yakka in the fields of law , medicine , sociology , anthropology and history .\\nEighteen years of positive discrimination in the public service , the news media and the arts .\\nIn sum , Three Waters is the culmination of a grand intellectual pincer movement .\\nOn the one hand , an immeasurably stronger alliance of Iwi-controlled institutions ; on the other , a state no longer capable of dismissing Māori leaders as “ haters and wreckers ” – or saying “ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pakeha nation .\\nThat was the core message embedded in the initial Three Waters advertising campaign .\\nMāori New Zealand was telling Pakeha New Zealand :',\n",

Israel has taken , Palestinian forbearance and adherence to the ceasefire persists , for now , with no missiles being launched from Gaza towards Israel .\\nOn 19 August , Israel shut down seven

informs us that it “ works in areas of extreme deprivation , refugee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training for psychiatrists , physicians , surgeons , nurses and allied professionals in primary trauma care , notably war wounds and burns , rehabilitation , and the mental health of children and adolescents.\\n” The Trust has a branch , IMET 2000-Palestine , which is particularly focused on mental and physical trauma in children resulting from conflict , severe economic deprivation , torture and abuse .\\nAmbulance drivers and paramedics are often first on the scene in an extreme emergency and provide the only medical skills immediately available .\\nIMET2000 therefore seeks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specialist training to encourage a multi-disciplinary approach centred on family practice clinics rather than hospitals .\\nB ‘ Tselem , the ‘ Israeli Information Centre for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories ’ , last year published an examination of Israel , entitled “ A regime of Jewish supremacy from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea : This is apartheid.\\n” The online newsletter , My Jewish Learning , describes the reluctance of “ the majority of Jews worldwide ” to subscribe to the

)\\nand the market is happy and somehow affordable housing must have been met .\\nThere are many obvious flaws in this logic , especially when applied to ‘ affordable housing ’ .\\nE.g .\\n: • Many people are not able to pay the prices the market has got to .\\nThey still need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the private market is sending signals to keep raising prices .\\nThe private market has a built in inflection through price to lock some people out of supply .\\nTo ration by price .\\n( Affordable food , shelter , are best not delivered by a private market mechanism .\\nSee our current private market supply chain problems as further proof .\\nWe can include clothing in this category if we want to introduce ethhics into our markets – most cheap/affordable clothing is based on exploitation ) .\\n• When demand starts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drop production ( this is a very early obvious signal ) .\\nSo they drop supply to a level to sustain residual demand in order to maintain their profit expectations ( maximise profits ) .\\nThis shows the private market has a built in tendency to maintain prices at high levels , the levels they have got to .\\nThe market has no incentive to maintain supply to drop prices because that will drop profit expectation .\\nFewer houses at a higher price makes more sense – contrast to low price high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the incentive even for them is keep prices high .\\nJust look at the New Zealand electricity market – there is competition but prices are still massively higher than when it was government run ( I recall $ 30 power bills , something like $ 60 in winter ) .\\n• Those people who are buying houses do not have the same access to information as those who are selling .\\nIn part because they buy less frequently .\\nBut more importantly when they buy they not only focused the price .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ price it is possible for the seller to use those other factors as a way to push up price to maximise profit .\\nThe buyer is therefore more likely to overpay which helps keep the market high .\\nSo the private market is skewed more easliy for the ability to maximise profits by a supplier rather than ‘ efficiently ’ setting price .\\nThis process favours those people positioned as the middle men in the market sitting between a producer and a final consumer .\\nSo the Labour/Green policy actions that promote the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to promote the supply of Affordable housing .\\nSteps they can take to promote affordable housing are : 1. remove the interest deduction subsidies for the ‘ build to rent ’ businesses .\\n2 .\\nStop the delegation to private developers of the right for them to force through their developments without community rights of complaint .\\nOn a positive note they can start some proper planning to build mid rise housing in true central city areas that are near or above retail areas .\\ni.e .\\nDo not delegate the power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the government to build affordable housing and directly fix the affordable housing problems .',\n",

       "  'title': 'Tax Cuts for 2023 election? Start with GST Mr Luxon',\n",
       "  'content': 'When Christopher Luxon announced his tax cuts proposal earlier this year it was widely scorned because , despite costing $ 1.7 billion , analysis showed most of the money would go to the wealthy .\\nA person on the minimum wage for example would get just an extra $ 112 per year while someone on a median salary of $ 55,000 would receive about $ 800 per annum .\\nHowever , those on the highest incomes would get the lion ’ s share with Luxon himself taking home a whopping $ 18,000 extra per year .\\nDespite the negative feedback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined to press on with a tax cut proposal .\\nIf they do , then the focus should be on cutting GST .\\nGST is a “ regressive tax ” which means it takes most from those on low and middle incomes and little from the very wealthy .\\nA cut in GST would benefit those facing the toughest times .\\nAlready Aotearoa New Zealand ’ s tax system is heavily weighted against those on low and middle incomes .\\nWage and salary earners pay the highest rates of tax because they pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every dollar they spend and for those on the lowest incomes the tax rates are particularly savage .\\nThe lowest 10 % of income earners spend 14 % of their net income on GST while the top 10 % spend less than 5 % of their income on GST .\\nSome countries , such as Australia , have exemptions for GST on such things as basic foods , medical and health care products .\\nWe have no exemptions .\\nConsidering GST and income tax together , a minimum wage worker pays nearly 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the super-rich will typically pay less than 10 % of theirs to the government .\\nIn tax talk this is politely expressed as “ the income sources of the super-rich do not attract tax as other activities do ” .\\nIn other words , there is a lot of freeloading going on .\\nFor example , in the 2014 tax year the HWI ( High Wealth Individuals ) unit of Inland Revenue found that 87 of the 212 New Zealanders with net wealth over $ 50 million were declaring incomes of less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were not even in the top income tax bracket !\\nIf “ tax is love ” as economist Shamubeal Equab says then there isn ’ t much love to go around at the top of the income pyramid .\\nSo why does GST affect those on low incomes the most ?\\nSimply because people on low incomes spend every dollar they earn but those on higher incomes are able to save and therefore pay a smaller share of their income on GST .\\nWe have what can only be described as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more unearned wealth you gain , the lower your overall tax rate will be .\\nIt ’ s as though the Sherriff of Nottingham designed our tax system .\\nIt wouldn ’ t look out of place in medieval Europe .\\nWhy on earth should we allow those on the lowest incomes pay the highest rates of tax ?\\nWhat our main political parties know is that their big political donations will quickly dry up if they propose the wealthy pay their fair share of tax .\\nThey have allowed themselves to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most basic changes to the tax system .\\nWe are already an outlier amongst countries we like to compare ourselves with by having a low top income tax rate and a capital gains tax which is easily avoided .\\nWe have been repeatedly told by politicians from the major parties that the best features of our tax system are its broad base and low rates .\\nIt sounds fair but in fact this is the very problem – it is the key driver of income and wealth inequality .\\nWe need a fairer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every dollar equally , no matter how it is earned .\\nAnd it ’ s time we got rid of GST altogether .\\nThe $ 26 billion to replace it can easily be found by taxing the unearned incomes and unearned wealth of the wealthy and super-wealthy .\\nIf the 1 % pay their fair share in tax the rest of us will all be better off .\\nSo let ’ s have this debate about tax cuts – starting with proposals to slash GST .',\n",

       "  'content': 'GERMAN CAPITALISM adapted itself to Nazi rule with a minimum of fuss and bother .\\nThis is hardly surprising , since Adolf Hitler and his National Socialists were the capitalists ’ best defence against the Communist Party of Germany – the political force which frightened Germany ’ s ruling-class the most .\\nSo long as the critical cultural and scientific infrastructure of Germany ’ s economic system remained intact , its capitalists neither criticised , nor resisted ( to any significant degree ) the Nazi regime ’ s monstrous crimes .\\nThe question raised by German capitalism ’ s close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubling one .\\nWas its amorality peculiar to the German people , or is a willingness to set aside moral considerations a feature baked into all capitalist systems – including our own ?\\nIn spite of their name , and especially after Hitler and the SS had purged its Stormtrooper militia of all those who took the socialist half of National Socialism seriously , the Nazis would prove to be a powerfully reinvigorating tonic for a capitalist system brought to its knees by the Great Depression .\\nThe full-scale rearmament of Germany , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ living space ” in the east , reduced unemployment dramatically , lifted the living-standards of the ordinary German worker , and restored capitalist profitability – all with astonishing speed .\\nWith the outbreak of war , especially its extension to the Soviet Union , and following Hitler ’ s declaration of war on the United States , German capitalism ’ s adaptation to the realities of global conflict involved it , increasingly , in activities of unprecedented human depravity .\\nNot only were German capitalists forced to accept slave labour as indispensable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ s war production , but they were also required to involve themselves in determining the most efficient methods for keeping their slaves alive and working , and for how long .\\nParadoxically , the necessity of boosting war production forced German capitalism to become vastly more efficient than it had been in the pre-war years .\\nIn Germany , as in the United States , the Soviet Union and Great Britain , mass production and economies of scale rationalised industrial production in ways that would force the world ’ s most powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the post-war world in conformity with the needs of what came to be known as “ Military Keynesianism ” .\\nFollowing Germany ’ s surrender in 1945 , American capitalists were keen to “ compare notes ” with their German equivalents .\\nAll agreed that while the need to fill the depleted ranks of the Wehrmacht with more and more German workers made the use of first , women , and then slaves , unavoidable ; forced labour in the context of complex industrial processes was grossly inefficient .\\nNot that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conglomerate from establishing a vast synthetic rubber production plant on the outskirts of the Auschwitz concentration camp .\\nNow in the territory of the Polish Republic , the plant ’ s successor operation remains in production to this day – one of the largest such facilities in the European Union .\\nCapitalism , like the cockroach , is infinitely adaptable – and very hard to kill .\\nWhich raises the question of how New Zealand capitalism ( and foreign-owned capitalist enterprises operating in New Zealand ) are likely to react to a fundamental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Māori – as envisioned in the He Puapua Report of 2019 .\\nWould such a radical and racially-charged re-constitution of the New Zealand state prompt capitalist resistance , or would New Zealand ’ s capitalists , like their German counterparts of the 1930s , simply adapt themselves , and their businesses , to the requirements of the new regime ?\\nThe first point to acknowledge is that German capitalists , regardless of their personal feelings towards the Nazis , were , as a class , in broad sympathy with their objectives .\\nReassured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of national socialism should not be taken seriously , the leaders of German industry and finance poured money into the Nazi Party ’ s coffers , and endured the street violence and antisemitism of its brownshirts as an unfortunate political necessity .\\nNot only did Nazism hold out the promise of rising profits , but it was also in sympathy , culturally and politically , with the most powerful elements of German society .\\nCan the same be said of the most powerful elements of New Zealand society ?\\nBroadly speaking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of neo-tribal capitalism , via the Treaty settlement process , beginning under the National Party in the early 1990s , was welcomed by New Zealand ’ s leading capitalists as infinitely preferable to the radical politicisation of a Māori working-class immiserated by Rogernomics and Ruthanasia .\\nA Māori “ renaissance ” , guided by traditional iwi leaders working hand-in-glove with the Crown , was containable .\\nAn angry cultural “ revolution ” , fuelled by poverty , and sweeping up poor Pakeha in its wake , was not .\\nThe Māori and Pakeha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bi-cultural and Aotearoa has been the New Zealand capitalists worst nightmare ever since their own , neoliberal , revolution in the mid-1980s .\\nJust as the Communist Party of Germany terrified the German ruling-class , a flax-roots alliance of the brown and the white and the poor , is what New Zealand capitalism has always feared the most .\\nThat is why neo-tribal capitalism and the He Puapua prescription are political manna from heaven for Pakeha capitalism .\\nThe deep cultural , social and political divisions which the co-governance project is bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the horizontal unity engendered by a flax-roots rebellion of the poor ( of all colours ) against the rich ( of all colours ) .\\nThe deep , deep cynicism of the Crown is almost admirable .\\nTo forestall a revolt from below – led by the Māori working-class – it first summoned into existence a neo-tribal capitalist Māori elite , and then joined hands with it to keep the poor in check .\\nAs the machinery of repression is rolled into place in advance of this new , undemocratic – but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zealand capitalists will hold themselves aloof from all the violence directed against the “ racist settler ” resistance .\\nThey may wince at the shutdown of dissenting media , and shake their heads sadly as the “ wrong sort ” of parties are proscribed , and defiant democratic resisters are carted off to jail , but , like their German counterparts in 1933 , they will not lift a finger to save “ New Zealand ” .\\nLike the Weimar Republic before it , the good and the bad of the doomed “ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dustbin of history .\\nNew Zealand capitalism , however , now a proudly bi-cultural affair , will survive – and prosper .',\n",

       "  'content': 'AUTHOR ’ S NOTE : I came across this column quite by accident while searching for information on another matter altogether .\\nIt was written about a certain evangelical gentleman of sinister mien , whose antics are still discombobulating liberals an astonishing after these words were written .\\nI didn ’ t know whether to laugh , or cry , at how very little has changed since late-August 2004 .\\nMY OLD MATE PETE left high school before I did and got himself a job at the General Motors warehouse in Upper Hutt .\\nThis was thirty-odd years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortage , and well-paid labouring jobs were everywhere .\\nPete would regale me with all kinds of stories about the people who worked alongside him in the sprawling GM complex , but there ’ s only one that has withstood the vicissitudes of thirty years .\\nThe sight of the Destiny Church marching through Wellington streets brought it all back : the story of Pete ’ s workmate – Lance .\\nLance was a big Māori guy who claimed to be a Vietnam vet .\\nPete was never quite sure if Lance was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked listening to his war stories anyway .\\nThe other thing Lance liked to talk about – apart from Vietnam and the army – was politics .\\nNot “ normal ” politics – he had no time for National or Labour or even Social Credit .\\nNo , Lance was into a weird , far-right mixture of politics and religion .\\nThe book he swore by was Hal Lindsey ’ s The Late Great Planet Earth .\\nAn incipient lefty , like me , Pete was spellbound by Lance ’ s radical right-wing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lasting impression .\\n“ When we come to power , ” Pete remembered Lance declaring , “ we ’ re going to liberate the police , and police the liberals.\\n” People talk about “ Māori radicals ” , tino rangatiratanga and the Treaty of Waitangi , and it sets off all kinds of political depth charges in New Zealand ’ s collective memory .\\nWe think of Syd Jackson and Nga Tamatoa , of Hana Te Hemara ’ s “ kill a Pakeha and die a hero ” speech , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Waitangi throughout the early eighties .\\nWe remember , too , that since the 1930s Māori have voted for the Labour Party .\\nMention Māori politics , and most people think left-wing .\\nBut it ain ’ t necessarily so .\\nMāori , like so many of the Polynesian peoples whose traditional religions were more or less destroyed through their contact with Christian missionaries in the 19th Century , adopted the conservative moral strictures of the new religion with extraordinary fervour .\\nChristian sexual morality , in particular , fastened heavy chains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefree and sexually polymorphous Polynesian spirit .\\nTo this day , the Samoan , Tongan and Fijian churches preside over some of the most sexually intolerant societies on Earth .\\nAnd the recent comments of New Zealand ’ s Anglican Archbishop on the subject of homosexuality , suggest that Māori Christians are no less intolerant than their Pacific Island co-religionists .\\nMore worrying still are the affinities many Māori leaders have indicated for the rigidly hierarchical and undemocratic social structures of their Pacific Island neighbours .\\nChiefly power is entrenched in both the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ultimate disadvantage of Tongan “ commoners ” and Fijian Indians .\\nThe Fijian Methodist Church openly endorses and supports the political claims of this indigenous Fijian aristocracy , and , to its eternal disgrace , failed to condemn either of the Fiji coups .\\nAdd this strong affinity for aristocratic political organisation to a deeply conservative Māori Christianity , and then mix in the powerful historical legacy of a social system in which warriors wielded enormous cultural power , and the resulting socio-political profile is anything but “ progressive ” .\\nIndeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where men like Lance – not to mention Brian Tamaki – can strut their stuff with far more self-assurance than any Māori radical .\\nSo , when I saw the footage of thousands of Destiny Church members marching down Lambton Quay on Monday afternoon , I couldn ’ t help recalling Lance ’ s promise to “ police the liberals ” , nor the strange millenarian fantasies drawn from his Late Great Planet Earth .\\nI wondered if he was there , somewhere in the midst of it all , and whether this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confident and charismatic leader , represented everything he – and thousands of conservative working-class Māori like him – had been waiting for since 1973 .\\nSome people – dear , brave Georgina Beyer among them – heard in Monday ’ s noisy display of fierce racial pride , aggressive political intolerance and fanatical religious belief , frightening echoes of Nuremberg .\\nBut what Brian Tamaki reminded me of was a poem , written by Sam Hunt , and published about the same time that my old mate Pete and I were kicking round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ s called Beware The Man , and three decades on , I can still recall some of the lines : Beware the man who tries to fit you out In his idea of a hat Dictating the size and colour of it … for more than that .\\nThis essay was originally published in The Dominion Post of Friday , 27 August 2004 .',\n",

she not been carrying a red umbrella on a day that smelled of rain , my eyes would have registered her presence , and continued searching .\\nBut the red umbrella fixed my gaze .\\nIt was the pre-arranged sign .\\nThis was the woman .\\nAs she came up the steps towards the bench I rose , as arranged , to greet her like an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I shook it gently .\\nAs she seated herself beside me , she took care to position the red umbrella between us .\\nA demarcator : on one side , her world ; on the other , mine .\\n“ I ’ m told you are in search of information , Mr … Smith ?\\n” No ?\\nYou surprise me .\\nMy name is Ms … Jones.\\n” “ What can you tell me about the Government ’ s war against ‘ misinformation ’ and ‘ disinformation ’ ?\\nAre my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to be taken seriously ?\\n” “ Direct and to the point .\\nI like that Mr Smith .\\nAt my age , time is precious .\\nSo , let me be equally direct .\\nYour sources are not exaggerating .\\nThe management of information is something this government takes extremely seriously .\\nIts predecessors had it much easier , of course .\\nFifty years ago there were so few disseminators of information .\\nKeeping the official story – or stories – straight involved managing maybe two or three hundred individuals – @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you ’ re talking thousands – tens of thousands – all on digital platforms which can be updated in an instant .\\nThousands of people espousing views pulled straight out of their arses .\\nOr , even worse , out of Russian , American and Chinese arses !\\n” “ But , surely , propaganda of one sort or another has been around forever ?\\nMisinformation and disinformation – they ’ re hardly new.\\n” “ No , that ’ s true .\\nBut the difference between the present and the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours and your opponents ’ – can be controlled .\\nThink about it .\\nThere have always been crazies out there .\\nPeople who wrote to the editor of the local paper using green ink and capital letters .\\nBut they weren ’ t a problem .\\nTheir letters were simply crumpled up and deposited in the nearest wastepaper bin .\\nAnd there was nothing , short of buying their own printing press , they could do about it .\\nBut today … Today they go on Facebook , Instagram , Twitter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or , if you ’ re Donald Trump , millions.\\n” “ Yes , well , now you ’ re getting to the heart of the problem .\\nLet ’ s start with the timing of this latest big push .\\nOur Prime Minister , horrified by the Christchurch mosque massacre , reaches out to Zuckerburg and his ilk .\\nBut , she also takes to heart the criticism of the Muslim community about the ‘ hate speech ’ that fuelled the horror .\\nAll the lies and half-truths circulating about Islam .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ took hold of Brenton Tarrant .\\nIt turned him into a mass murderer.\\n” “ Okay .\\nBut Tarrant was refighting the crusades .\\nHow do you prevent that ?\\nClose all the libraries ?\\n” “ A fair question .\\nBut let me move the narrative on .\\nTen months after Christchurch , Covid-19 arrives on the scene .\\nIt ’ s new , and no one is at all sure how deadly this novel coronavirus is going to be .\\nOne thing the experts do know , however , is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be made a whole lot worse by people spreading misinformation and disinformation on the Internet .\\nSo the DPMC hires people to monitor what ’ s happening online vis-à-vis the pandemic .\\nThe results are frightening .\\nIt ’ s a nutfest out there.\\n” “ And the Prime Minister , her government , and their advisers , are all convinced that these nutters have to be monitored and , if possible , reined-in , before they undermine the ‘ Team of Five Million ’ s ’ battle against the virus – @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , Mr Smith , well-spotted .\\nBut it gets worse .\\nIn the minds of the Government and its advisers , the anti-vaxxers and Wuhan Flu conspiracy theorists begin to merge with the white supremacists , Nazis , Islamophobes , transphobes and TERFs .\\nAs far as Labour and the Greens are concerned they are dangerous nutters : people who can do real harm to others .\\nAnd the people who defend these dangerous nutters ’ right to free speech are little better than Typhoid Marys – allowing the viruses of hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ Is it ?\\nYou ’ re not the Prime Minister .\\nYou ’ re not being accosted by these nutters every time you venture forth to promote vaccination .\\nYou ’ re not receiving e-mailed death threats – and worse – every day of the week .\\nYou ’ re not looking down on Parliament Grounds at a seething mass of what looks like every green ink correspondent that ever lived waving hangman ’ s nooses and threatening to execute the entire House of Representatives .\\nYou ’ d like to laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington DC on 6 January 2021 , and suddenly you no longer feel like laughing.\\n” “ And then they start thinking about Three Waters , and He Puapua and co-governance.\\n” “ Clever boy .\\nTheir great fear is that what the anti-vaxxers started , the racists will finish .\\nThey ’ re thinking of all the misinformation and disinformation that ’ s already being spread about the transformation of New Zealand into Aotearoa , and they ’ re telling themselves that these digital reactionaries can not be allowed to win .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to crush the legitimate aspirations of the Māori minority .\\nThe racists ’ misinformation and disinformation must be stopped.\\n” “ And so we get the Public Interest Broadcasting Fund , and journalists trying to convince us that there are right-wing monsters moving in the darkness.\\n” “ And that is when people like me enter the story .\\nPeople who can gently steer journalists in the right direction .\\nPeople who can identify potential journalistic assets and supply them with the information they would have very little chance of unearthing without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information that makes their careers .\\nPeople who can suggest which anti-government voices are most deserving of being silenced .\\nYou look shocked Mr Smith .\\nYou shouldn ’ t be .\\nWe spooks have been doing this sort of thing for years – just like the Australians , the Americans and the Brits .\\nThe thing you ’ ve got to understand about misinformation and disinformation , Mr … Smith , is that they ’ re like machine guns and artillery – much too dangerous to have just anybody firing them off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state can wield.\\n” She rose carefully from her seat , as if her joints were giving her discomfort .\\nGlanced up at the grey clouds gathering before a sharp south wind , and pulled her coat more tightly about her .\\n“ It ’ s coming on to rain , Mr … Smith .\\nMy car ’ s on the other side of the park – not far .\\nSo , since we know you came on foot , I ’ ll leave you the umbrella .\\n”',\n",

       "  'content': 'Long term renters in New Zealand have rightly complained long and hard about how high rents are .\\nThe propaganda to explain this is high prices are caused by a chronic supply shortage due to a failure to build because of the problems with building and planning consent processes i.e .\\nprivate enterprise would have built but weren ’ t allowed .\\nComplete and utter lies on planning* and no excuse to destroy our cities .\\nBut we do need to build more affordable homes for renters ( and purchasers ) and government policies of encouraging ‘ build to rent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they believe the private market is the appropriate model to deliver affordable housing but here is proof the market will not provide it .\\nWe know that a lot of the current rental housing in New Zealand was taken up with supplying short term accomodation e.g .\\ntourists , ( approx .\\n4M tourists before Covid many using AirBnb etc ) , and overseas students coming here , studying while working .\\nThis excessive demand helped create the housing shortage and drove up rents .\\nOften short term rentals were seen by landlords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but people were not in the accomodation as much and consequentially did not cause as much wear and tear .\\nLess work overall .\\nBut Covid has collapsed these demand markets .\\nWe don ’ t have tourists .\\nWe don ’ t have overseas students .\\nWe know their are hundreds of vacant rental properties in Wellington .\\nSurely this would have a massive impact on the rental market , wouldn ’ t the rental market have collapsed !\\nEr , no .\\nLong term renters are still paying a fortune .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ and maintain their high asking prices to rent .\\nOtherwise some of their existing tenants may try and leave their current rentals to get a cheaper one elsewhere and that would not maximise the landlords profit .\\nBut even if prices drop a little , what is the point for the renter in going elsewhere if the price is very similar .\\nAnd our tax system allows losses that help maintain this practise of holding rentals empty so the market does not drop ; ring fencing losses does not fix this .\\nAlso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inelastic .\\nPeople don ’ t find it easy to move as they need predictability for schools , work , transport , and recreation opportunities .\\nSo that inertia is exploited in price because there is no mechanism for existing rentals to access a lower market price , except by leaving .\\nYou can argue the price they continue to pay reflects their needs for staying in the rental .\\nBut that price no longer reflects that there is an oversupply and prices have not dropped .\\nAnd the much promoted solution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher prices is very difficult with a high cost product like housing .\\nAnd even then any new competitor wants to maximise profit so they don ’ t want to undercut too much .\\nWhat this all means is that the price at which affordable housing is delivered by the market is not primarily determined by supply , but by pricing .\\nAnd pricing is determined by the need to maximise profit .\\nAnd if a high price exists every incentive is there to keep it high , to maximise profit .\\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are putting their faith in the private market to supply housing to fix the affordable housing crisis .\\nAt best this is misguided ; at worst it is simple stupidity and ignorance in the face of plain and obvious facts .\\n( I say this strongly because some people/children sleep in cars , and we have a rheumatic fever problem ) .\\nWhen housing prices are unaffordable as currently ; the market simply rations by price .\\nIf you can ’ t pay you can ’ t have .\\nThis is a socially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nLet the market deliver hotels , up market houses , and similar .\\nBut the private enterprise market is simply not an appropriate mechanism to deliver affordable housing because it can ’ t .\\nThe government must get rid of tax subsidies ( interest ) for ‘ build to rent ’ rent for life companies ( possibly an exception is made for non-profits , and Maori authorities if non-profit , but this depends on how they set prices ) .\\nThis will slow private builds freeing up resources that can be focused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the building of affordable houses to fix the crisis .\\nMore can be said on how this crisis can be fixed quite quickly .\\n• New Zealand doesn ’ t have a proper or adequate urban planning process so private enterprise is constantly trying to build the wrong types of developments in the wrong areas because it is cheaper for them to do so and they can increase their profit .\\nAnd that inadequate planning process comes about because governments and councils are constantly trying to appease business and their desire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the economy .\\nBusiness is coddled through property rights and zoning restrictions .',\n",

       "  'content': 'Grant Robinson is an excellent politician ( one of the best ) but is this centrist skill set best suited in a world that calls for visionary leadership to get us out of the serious problems we have ?\\nAnd remember centrist approaches are a key reason why we have serious problems like the climate crisis .\\nAchilles of course was the invincible champion of the greek army outside the walls of Troy .\\nHis passion and fearlessness in battle was such that when he was offended and stormed off to sulk in his tent ; each greek leader in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nAnd though he did eventually , ( we know from another story he died from an arrow to the heel ) he is not mentioned at the final Greek victory over Troy .\\nChloe Swarbruck was very reasonable in expecting backing for her bill to remove alcohol sponsorship in sport , due to the huge social problems alcohol creates .\\nBut Grant was concerned by the disruption to funding and potential budget impacts .\\nBut why this debate ?\\nEach issue stands on its own merits , not a false relativity or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows the fear at the heart of a centrist approach , an unwillingness to deal with consequences from taking a rational action .\\nBecause consequences mean disruption and that means political risk , i.e.\\n, you might get blamed at a later date .\\nIt is risk averse stance i.e .\\nput up with existing problems ( you can ’ t be blamed as you didn ’ t cause it ) .\\nFuture problems from change are overplayed and benefits are underplayed .\\nAnd where is this centrist approach learned ?\\nIt is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties approach problems when in government and ( against all logic ) are highly successful at staying in power .\\nOn issues that are not core to them , conservatives try to be seen to do something , but do minimal e.g .\\nThe bright line test for taxing property sales , but only if sold within 2 years .\\nHardly an effective action to cool house prices , and it didn ’ t ( an outcome great for their property owner voters ) .\\nBut the pressure came off .\\nThe media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labour mimics this and tries to play down real action .\\nNot do too much ; gun shy and cowed by mostly the right wing press pantomiming risks , but also the rest of the press can latch onto actions and that can get tough .\\nBut does this centrism really work for Labour ?\\nLabour is positioned as a party of change , a party that wants to look after those who are disadvantaged ; ‘ the bottom feeders ’ as Mr Luxon so callously called them .\\nWhat are the centrists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they just holding power ?\\nGST on Kiwisaver funds could be seen as taking on the big boys .\\nArmageddon was predicted by the same people who haven ’ t said much about the colosal share markets loses over recent years .\\nLabour backed off , lesson learned – don ’ t rock the big boy boats or you could lose elections .\\nBut Labour/Green centrists have a limited policy vision of how the economy could work , e.g.\\n, they could be investigating a public option for Kiwisaver using the power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profits would go to overseas based providers .\\nPrivate providers would quake in their boots but this is no revolution , it ’ s just providing a very good choice beneficial to New Zealand in a market framework .\\nIt ’ s done elsewhere in the world .\\nCentrist Labour believes it can deliver for its voters while holding a core belief that the role of government is to facilitate business and not be in any market .\\nThis is a supposed learning from previous decades of government inefficiency , rather than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of government efficiency .\\nThis core belief means Labour has its core strength , the power of government , tied behind its back , unlike the so successful first Labour Government .\\nThe first Labour government shifted the middle .\\nAnd their reliance on the market to deliver makes fools of them , as they are still accountable for the obvious failures of private enterprise e.g .\\nelectricity market , grocery prices , price of oil .\\nBy having this core belief and avoiding the possibility of a government option creates a key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to satisfy two different sets of voters .\\nIt ’ s own constituents ( with the need for change ) .\\nAnd trying to appease the big boys , the other sides voters .\\nBecause if you ’ re doing any meaningful change you will always upset the big boys .\\nSo doing nothing/little/guiding seems palatable because you might win voters with less controversy .\\nAnd note — conservatives don ’ t have to do this .\\nThey just have to look after their own .\\nJust think of Bill English ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tax cuts .\\nCompletely ruinous to our economy and the ability of government to function .\\nBut he delivered for his voters .\\nCentrists misunderstand the dynamic of what actually gets conservatives elected .\\nConservatives are actually visionary extremists who will say and do anything to win .\\nA history of racist campaigns e.g .\\niwi/kiwi ; calling compulsory super communism ( we lost hundreds of millions because of it ) ; the mother of all budgets that striped millions out of provincial New Zealand .\\nA ‘ think big ’ pile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Billion hole in Labour finances .\\nConservatives have more in common with Rasputin , yet the centrists fret over doing something wrong , all while our civil society is attacked .\\nBut the most disgusting result of this centrist thinking , is it means punching down on your own supporters , to ‘ balance ’ the two positions .\\nCurrently Labour/Greens are punching down on local democracy to encourage bully building up to 6 stories so you lose your sun and privacy , with your rights to complain removed .\\nThese will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nDo they think there won ’ t be voting consequences ?\\nThey are walking into a trap of their own making once buildings start going up .\\nDevelopers have been given an almost open book to destroy heritage .\\nCentrists claim without evidence it is about building affordable housing .\\nCentrists relying on the market did this because they listened to businesses and want to appease them .\\nYes , there are Labour/green supporters who need affordable housing ; but these changes do nothing to deliver affordable housing , they are about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can only be filled by government ( there may be a few non-profits ) .\\nCentrists are about punching down rather than punching the businesses who need to use their central city lands more efficiently .\\nProper planning is needed .\\nLabour currently looks weak and directionless on policy .\\nAnd this is despite Willis and Luxon showing their own gaping policy void with hysterical hyperbolic ravings on GST and Kiwisaver that only look like something was being said .\\nSo the greeks 10 years outside the walls of Troy with their great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nowhere .\\nThe hero Achilles is not mentioned anymore in the story ( perhaps there perhaps not ) .\\nBut the greeks changed , they had to be clever , a new idea , a direction , a vision , to fight and win .\\nA Trojan horse , a government role .\\nBecause otherwise they knew they were slowly but surely losing .',\n",

       "  'content': 'On the night of 31 August , just minutes before the expiry of her four-year term as the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , Michelle Bachelet released her promised report on serious human rights abuses in China ’ s Xinjiang region .\\nThe very next day , on the first day of September , Radio New Zealand ( RNZ ) reported our Foreign Affairs Minister , Nanaia Mahuta , describing the report as “ deeply concerning ” .\\nAccording to RNZ , she went further , not only calling on China to uphold its international human rights obligations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the report but also noting that the New Zealand Government had been consistent in raising “ grave concerns ” regarding the treatment of Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang .\\nOnly a few hours before releasing her report on Xinjiang , the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights had also issued a press release , deploring Israel ’ s refusal to grant visas for UN Human Rights Staff in the Occupied West Bank .\\nShe deplored Israel ’ s action as “ part of a wider and worrying trend to block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory ” , noting that : “ This raises the question of what exactly the Israeli authorities are trying to hide.\\n” Michelle Bachelet ‘ s press release reminded the world that Israel ’ s hold on Palestine grows ever more deadly .\\nWill our Foreign Affairs Minister show similarly grave concern over this report ?\\nThroughout last year , Israeli Occupation forces killed 320 Palestinians ( a tenfold increase on the number killed in 2020 ) and injured 17,042 people ( six times the 2020 figure ) .\\nThe UN has also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since 2017 and , so far this year , Israeli forces have killed at least 111 more Palestinians .\\nWhat concern has our Foreign Affairs Minister shown in response to an earlier briefing by Michelle Bachelet to the UN Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People , regarding the “ disastrous ” violations of human rights being committed by Israel against some four million people ?\\nThe UN Human Rights Office in Palestine is mandated to monitor Israel and its duty to comply with international human rights obligations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister ?\\nBachelet set an example to the mainstream news media and politicians in seeking to find out what the Israeli Occupation is trying to hide .\\nEverything about Israel ’ s conduct concerning the Palestinian people is devious – take , for instance , the imposition of Administrative Detention , which epitomises such injustice .\\nAccording to the Israeli Information Centre for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories , B ’ Tselem , Israel has contrived a method by which to imprison Palestinians , without charge and with whatever evidence it claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imprisonment is renewable , indefinitely .\\nB ’ Tselem states : “ The power to incarcerate people who have not been convicted or even charged with anything for lengthy periods of time , based on secret “ evidence ” that they can not challenge , is an extreme power .\\nIsrael uses it continuously and extensively , routinely holding hundreds of Palestinians at any given moment.\\n” Last month ’ s Israeli Court sentencing of a Palestinian World Vision Australia worker , Mohamed el-Halabi , to 12 years in prison is yet another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contempt for truth .\\nEl-Halabi was accused of having diverted tens of millions of Australian taxpayer dollars to Hamas but , as the Canberra Times reported , independent audits by the Australian Government and World Vision Australia , conducted by Deloitte in 2017 , found no evidence of wrongdoing .\\nIsrael subjects even children to this appalling , secretive form of incarceration .\\nLast July , an End-of-Mission Statement by the UN Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices reported that “ Palestinian children are routinely intimidated by Israeli security forces on the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their right to education , despite the UN Secretary-General ’ s repeated calls on Israel to better protect schools as places of learning.\\n” It is important to recognise the UN Committee ’ s concern over the Zionist state ’ s refusal to engage with the UN mission , which it regards as a reflection of Israel ’ s “ entrenched culture of impunity.\\n” The UN statement noted that , at the time of the report , there were four Palestinian children being held under indefinite administrative detention , without charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of the organisations raided by Israel last month , says the only children in the world treated in this racist manner are Palestinian .\\nThe Special Committee reported evidence of Palestinian children facing constant intimidation on their way to school , despite the UN Secretary-General ’ s repeated calls on Israel to better enable access to schools as peaceful providers of education .\\nIsrael ’ s obsession with ‘ security ’ is exemplified in what happened earlier this year when Israeli forces invaded , before dawn , a Bedouin village home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and around 30 Israeli personnel forced their way in to awaken and abduct a 12-year-old boy , Ammar , accused of having attended a demonstration against Occupation land-clearances .\\nThe boy was eventually returned to his home , traumatised and speechless .\\nA field researcher for the Adalah organisation of defence lawyers , Marwan Abu Frieh , described how Israeli interrogators intimidate children to remain silent over what happened to them under interrogation as well as to fear demonstrating in future .\\nWhile Palestinian children , up to and including 14 years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court within 12 hours of their arrest , Israeli police repeatedly apply to Occupation courts for detention periods to be extended which , of course , is usually granted .\\nMarwan spoke of one 14-year-old whose detention had been extended six times .\\nAt its worse , by 18 August , the 2022 death toll taken by Israel on Palestinian children had already reached 37 .\\nIn the Occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem , Israel ’ s discriminatory planning and zoning laws , as well as military orders , are used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in order to enlarge illegal Israeli settlements and military training areas .\\nIsrael uses Administrative Detention as a most effective tool in silencing the voices of an overrun native population that , quite naturally , protest against such injustices .\\nThe Committee also received photographic evidence of agricultural , industrial and chemical waste-disposal by Israeli commercial interests onto farmland that threatened the Palestinian people ’ s right to a healthy environment .\\nThe latest development in Israel ’ s growing population-control , reported by the BBC , invades the most intimate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ‘ defence ‘ ministry now demands that foreigners in love with a Palestinian must declare as much officially and , should there be marriage , will find themselves forced to leave the territory after 27 months for a ‘ cooling-off period ‘ of at least six months .\\nThe isolation of Palestine takes another step forward .\\nThe BBC reports the Israeli human rights organisation , HaMoked , warning : “ They make it much more difficult for people to come and work in Palestinian institutions , volunteer , invest , teach and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in the hands of the Israeli Ministry of ‘ Defence ’ unit , Cogat .\\nIsrael ’ s arbitrary renaming of the West Bank territory is to be found in the Cogat order Procedure for entry and residence of foreigners in the Judea and Samaria area .\\nJewish settlements , imposed by Israel upon the territory are , of course , exempt from the order .\\nThere is already a longstanding Israeli ban on granting residency to foreign spouses of Palestinians in the West Bank and thousands of people are forced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new rules also impose draconian travel restrictions and one of the petitioners against them , Dr Benjamin Thomson , who heads the Canadian charity , Keys to Health , which sends medical professors from North America and the UK to train Palestinian doctors , commented , “ anyone involved in work in the Occupied Territories of Palestine is already familiar with the multiple administrative delays in getting permission.\\n” He notes also that “ these new regulations make delays worse , increase cost , and decrease the predictability of travel in and out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blind ideology and material self-interest , open minds unite to reject the Zionist ‘ anti-Semitism ’ fraud .\\nJews and non-Jews across the world , oppose the ever-growing illegal Israeli settlements , the land-seizures , the displacing of Palestinian residents and the destruction of their homes and property .\\nThese crimes are perpetrated by Israel in defiance of UN Security Council Resolution 2334 and it should be remembered that New Zealand not only voted for but also co-sponsored the resolution .\\nThis week , four Israeli teenagers who were called up for military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Evyatar Moshe Rubin and Nave Shabtay Levin , have been imprisoned for refusing to serve in the Israeli Occupation and control of the Palestinian people .\\nThese courageous youngsters declare : “ We , Israeli youth , refuse to join the Israeli army and take part in the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza strip .\\nWe call out to all citizens of Israel to open their eyes and see the policy of oppression over the Palestinian people carried out by the Israeli government.\\n” They also object to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system “ teaching us to hate our neighbours ” and obscuring “ the true reality in the Palestinian territories with children and youth.\\n” In spite of New Zealand ‘ s commitment to UN Security Council Resolution 2334 , we hear not the slightest expression of concern from our Foreign Affairs Minister .\\nIsrael is using the Occupied West Bank territory as a population-control laboratory – the longer it is enabled to exercise such defiance of international human rights law without being called to account , the greater grows the threat to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will MFAT , Nanaia Mahuta and the New Zealand Government actually show any concern or support for the victims ?\\nWill they urgently join the human rights demand for Israel to be brought to account ?',\n",

       "  'content': 'IF YOU WANT TO KNOW why Labour leaves the most disadvantaged New Zealanders to rot in motels – ask the Rogernomes .\\nEver since Labour abandoned its democratic-socialist beliefs and embraced neoliberalism in 1984 , the party has been at pains to keep the disadvantaged politically disorganised and dependent on the good will of the state .\\nThey do not do this in expectation of their votes – any votes they get from the welfare underclass are a bonus – they do it because they don ’ t want them to vote at all .\\nTo fully appreciate the reasoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is necessary to go back to the year 1984 and take a look around .\\nNew Zealand society was mobilised in a way that “ Rogernomic ’ s Children ” – the generations that grew up with no memories of what New Zealand was like before the neoliberal “ revolution ” – would struggle to accept .\\nCivil society had power in those years .\\nCitizens had power .\\nEven the poor and the unemployed had power .\\nRight across the country unemployed workers and beneficiaries were being organised .\\nThe state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to help – not hinder – its citizens .\\nAccordingly , the state made funds available to just about any organisation set up to help citizens in need .\\nThis included groups set up to assist the unemployed and beneficiaries access the support and services to which they were legally entitled .\\nCentres were established where people on benefits could meet and discuss their problems .\\nBy the middle of 1984 , more and more beneficiaries were becoming politicised .\\nHow politicised ?\\nPoliticised enough to turn out and vote in record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of registered voters made it to a polling-booth .\\nIn spite of the fact that these politicised beneficiaries had voted overwhelmingly for David Lange ’ s Labour Party , the neoliberal cabal of Roger Douglas , David Caygill , Richard Prebble , Michael Bassett and Mike Moore , were acutely aware that politicised workers and beneficiaries were , potentially , their worst enemies .\\nThe changes they were about to unleash on New Zealand would swell the numbers of the poor and the marginalised .\\nThe last thing the Rogernomes needed was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find their voice .\\nThe Fourth Labour Government ’ s solution was as cynical as it was clever .\\nFirst , it set up an elaborate employment programme for middle-class people who had lost their jobs called “ Access ” .\\nCome up with an idea for “ helping ” the poor and disadvantaged and the government appointed Regional Employment and Access Councils ( composed of one third employers , one third unions , and one third representing the rest of society ) had money to give you – lots of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schemes and the Project Employment Programme schemes which had resourced the organisers of the beneficiaries ’ movement was that the Access schemes had to be strictly apolitical .\\nThe people running them ( on excellent salaries ! )\\nwere to be the poor ’ s responsible helpers and guides – not their political advocates .\\nOstensibly , the people attending these Access schemes were there to be assisted into appropriate paid employment .\\nIn reality , they were there to provide a rationale for the generous resourcing of Access managers .\\nUnsurprisingly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bite the Labour hands that fed them .\\nTo those unemployed and beneficiaries lacking the entrepreneurial skills to take advantage of the Access schemes , the Fourth Labour Government offered the dole : the whole dole ; and nothing but the dole .\\nThe bureaucrats in charge of social welfare were not encouraged , as they are now , to micromanage their “ clients ” .\\nTheir “ stick ” was nowhere near as big and frightening as the one they wield today .\\nThe idea was brutally simple : give the poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and let them rot .\\nPoverty is only dangerous , politically , when it is widely shared .\\nConfine real poverty to between a quarter and a third of the entire population , rob its victims of the political leadership needed to mobilise them as an electoral force , and the poor become the precise opposite of dangerous – they become harmless .\\nOnce poverty acquires a stigma : once its victims begin to blame themselves for their misfortunes ; self-hatred sets in .\\nPeople begin to withdraw from a society that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand .\\nTo alleviate their misery they turn to alcohol , drugs , gambling , sex – anything that serves to dull the pain of unbelonging .\\nIn the end they become anomic – beyond caring , beyond acting , beyond help .\\nOr , from the neoliberals ’ point-of-view : Safe .\\nThe one weakness in the neoliberal plan for the poor is its cost .\\nIf poverty and unemployment grows , then the cost of keeping its victims safe rapidly becomes prohibitive .\\nRuth Richardson ’ s “ Mother of All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lessened the state ’ s burden , but it did not remove it .\\nWelfare roll reduction thus became the new priority : get the poor off the benefit – by any means necessary .\\nIt was a song National and Labour sang with equal gusto .\\nTurns out that having between a quarter and a third of the population roped-off from the rest of the nation : prey to poverty , plagued by crime , prone to violence , and just not giving a fuck ; isn ’ t all that helpful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nEven less helpful is the inconvenient fact that a disproportionate number of these unreachable ones have brown skins .\\nThe state tried , and the state failed – badly – to reach out to the Māori and Pasifika communities being devastated by Covid-19 .\\nTo vaccinate as many vulnerable citizens as possible , the hard-and-fast rule , enforced by successive neoliberal governments for thirty-five years , was set aside .\\nGrass-roots advocacy groups were empowered and resourced to get the Covid vaccine out and into the arms of the poor .\\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the state , and the care provided by their own people , proved to be decisive .\\nBecause something else was being injected into them along with the Pfizer vaccine .\\nIt was a story in which even they , the poor and the stigmatised , had a place to stand .\\nA story about a country that had once been theirs : about rights and resources guaranteed by a treaty that was not honoured ; about a country that could be theirs again – but only if they made a conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dangerous story for a Labour Government still content , like its predecessors , to push the poor out of the picture .\\nNot into the low-cost housing of the 1980s – that is long gone – but into motels .\\nOut of sight , out of mind .\\nSecond-class citizens in third-rate private accommodation .\\nCramped .\\nCold .\\nPreyed upon by gangsters in uniform .\\nDesperate .\\nLeft to rot .\\nBut not bereft – not this time .\\nAnomie can not survive the rebirth of hope .\\nAlienation flees before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it came from a party promising to “ lift them up where they belonged ” .\\nIn 2022 , it is coming from a party urging them to lift themselves up .\\nThat party is currently polling 5 percent .\\nAfter nearly forty years , the poor have recovered their voice .',\n",

       "  'content': 'New Zealand has been blighted by heavy immigration .\\nJust ask a Maori .\\nIt lead to intergenerational theft of wealth resources through pakeha provoked military violence , blatant violations of Treaty clauses , murders and rapes .\\nAll leading to poverty and social ostracism in their own country , which is still currently reflected in low levels of health , high crime statistics and a lower life expectancy .\\nConsider the poverty of immigrants living in late 1800s United States , or the fate of native American people .\\nAnd if you think that ’ s ancient history then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good .\\nImmigration is not a simple ‘ good ’ .\\nBut almost all discussion of immigration currently happens within the inadequate framework of what business and economists think about economic growth .\\nSo a bit of background .\\nJust before the covid lockdown , immigration to New Zealand almost reached 200,000 .\\nAnd we had a raging housing affordability crisis .\\nOur infrastructure ; transport , public transport , education , health were all still struggling .\\n( Labour has massively increased spending in all these areas — in contrast to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything into the ground ) .\\nThe Productivity Commission has estimated a $ 104 Billion infrastructure underspend has been run up .\\nBut still some in the business community think New Zealand over the next 10 years should have another 4 million people ( 400,000 immigrants a year ! )\\nwithout raising taxes ( well it cost ’ s us and you nothing to train them and they are better/more skilled than New Zealanders , and less crime so cheaper — all simplistic insights ) .\\nSome business leaders want a right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a job to offer the immigrant ( there is risk some will pay for a job to come here ) .\\nTo the business community everything on the benefit side is a gim me .\\nAny costs are government costs .\\nSo when it comes to impacts , the two things we know about the business community ; it ’ s narrow minded , and self-serving .\\nBut beyond the infrastructure costs , how much immigration is good ?\\nImagine if we allowed in a million — Chinese communist party members , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other groups would have significant cultural impacts .\\nWould Maori retain their currently slightly improved societal standing ?\\nLGBTQ ?\\nThe fact is we want immigrants , to assimilate to our society and cultural values .\\nTolerance for diversity , respect for the Treaty , respect for equality and the rule of law , adherence to democracy , openness to dialogue , rejection of corruption , acceptance of freedom of speech , etc .\\nThese are not a given .\\nOur cultural respect of immigrants does not extend to accepting hate speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maga appear to be struggling with this .\\nEven Britain has struggled with some residual female genital mutilation , etc .\\nWe have value judgements that say you can ’ t have some of your cultural values .\\nAt heart democracy is dependent on enough people being tolerant that a less tolerant minority can be respected but ignored in the democratic sense , and controlled in a legal sense .\\nStability and prosperity helps this process of assimilation , but the volume of people does too .\\nBut we aren ’ t pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our democracy repeatedly delivered a ‘ kingmaker ’ who was percieved by some to hold ‘ change ’ hostage and had a tinge of racism to their appeal .\\nDealing with climate change and a whole host of issues was seriously impacted .\\nThe kingmaker problem could come back .\\nWe are lucky at the moment that both liberals and conservatives are behind the benefits of immigration .\\nNot long ago we had more divisive political campaigns like iwi/kiwi .\\nOur democracy is fragile .\\nWe do not have a constitution or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these/our values in place .\\nCourts capable of defending civil rights outside of legislative dictate e.g .\\nThe three strikes bill should have able to be looked at as a civil right issue and able to be struck down .\\nWe have to undertake a constitutional journey before we undertake any major levels of immigration , because the risks are great .\\nSo lets just not turn the immigration taps back on full bore as the government has recently done with students and working visas : 1 : Immigration must not outpace infrastructure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This means business must face a hard discussion on how much to increase taxation on them .\\nThey are one of the main drivers for immigration .\\nThere is no gim me .\\nHow about some user pays for the $ 104billion infrastructure deficit .\\n( The tax on the economic growth from immigration won ’ t cover it as business tax rates are so low ) , 2 : The volume of immigration must allow society to adapt and evolve without stress .\\nWhy not align to the birth rate ?\\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the individual of a collective awareness of how much it costs in society to have children i.e .\\ncan afford new people ?\\nOr it gives an indication of what locals expect to see for new people in their community ?\\n( I claim as much credibility as some economist math geek , the most discredited profession in the world , who draws a chart and declares their idea true ) .\\nSo births are about 56,000 a year and immigrants could match that .\\nThe previous gungho of over 100,000 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it created infrastructure and cultural stress .\\nHistory tells us immigration should not be a dominant experience for a community .\\n3 : A process to develop a constitution and true bill of rights must occur before any major immigration increase over the already quite high birth rate level suggested here .\\nImmigration is undoubtedly good for society but difference has consistently been used in the past by the less scrupulous for negative purposes ( e.g .\\nBrexit ) .\\nA smaller volume in immigration to better match our population size would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assimilation which is essential for a happy society .\\np.s .\\nBut there is the problem of immigration administration and bureaucracy .\\nA possible way to deal with some of that is , if a business wants to make a job offer to a person and bring them in as a right to be an immigrant ( subject I assume to a criminal record check and that the person is trained and specialised etc ) .\\nThey could be matched to a women over the age of 40 who by choice or chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has created a gap in societys projected population increase .\\nShe ’ s owns that outcome .\\nWhy can ’ t she sell that population ‘ gap ’ , one only ( unless the birth rate was over 2 ) , to a business , say for $ 100,00 or more , could be bid for if demand was over that minimum ?\\nThe woman gets the money .\\n( There are serious issues to iron out but overall less bureacracy than years of a points system ) .\\nSo , what would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year half female , supposedly 1 in 5 women do not have children ) 5,600 positions a year ( plus the backlog of previous years ) .\\nThat seems like a lot of people for business to bring in relatively trouble free .\\nObvioulsy this figure is within the 56,00 immigrant level .\\nA high enough price to discourage a business just being a backdoor immigration route ?',\n",

then the general collapse of the Russian Federation ( RF ) forces in the face of the general offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine ( AFU ) is explained .\\nAgainst a military force trained and equipped with the latest high-tech weapons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose commanders , unlike their Russian counterparts , are encouraged to take the initiative and make their own battlefield decisions , and whose already sky-high morale is now off-the-scale , the RF has very little to offer by way of effective resistance .\\nImages recorded on the advancing AFU troops ’ smartphones show tanks and armoured vehicles abandoned on the roadsides .\\nPerhaps they are empty of fuel .\\nPerhaps they have no more ammunition left to fire at the enemy .\\nWhatever the explanation , their crews have fled towards the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Russian border .\\nMoscow is attempting to portray this as a “ regrouping ” – it is no such thing .\\nWhat the world is looking at here ( at least that part of the world which is not obsessively following the “ coffin ” – i.e .\\nthe body – of the late Queen on its journey south to London ) is not a “ re-grouping ” – it ’ s a rout .\\nJust how serious the situation has become for the Russian Government of Vladimir Putin is captured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , supposedly spoken by a representative of the leadership of the Russian General Staff : “ Our troops have no more offensive capabilities , and soon there will be no more opportunities for defence .\\nYou lost Vladimir Vladimirovich !\\n” Taken together with the already confirmed reports of representative bodies in St Petersburg and Moscow passing resolutions demanding Putin be charged with treason , and reports of military movements in the capital suggestive of preparations for a military coup d ’ état and it is difficult to resist the conclusion that Putin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) survival must now be considered doubtful .\\nPutin and his coterie of supportive oligarchs , bureaucrats , and politicians will be desperate , now , to fix the blame for the military catastrophe unfolding across Eastern Ukraine on his battlefield commanders .\\nHis mouthpieces are already calling for the execution of these “ treacherous generals ” .\\nThe military commanders of the Russian Federation must , therefore , move with the utmost haste to protect themselves from the wrath of “ Vladimir Vladimirovich ” .\\nBy decapitating the political leadership , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the personal survival of these principal players at stake at this critical moment , but so , too , is the general shape and structure of the Russian Federation .\\nIn 1905 , the Russian Czar , Nicholas II , suffered a catastrophic naval defeat at the hands of the Japanese Empire – an “ upstart ” power whose military capabilities the Russians had fatally underestimated .\\nThe result was a nationwide uprising which came within an ace of overturning the Russian autocracy .\\nPutin ’ s oligarch allies will not want defeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” Ukrainians to spark a third Russian revolution .\\nBetter to depose Putin quickly and cleanly , make peace with Ukraine , and restore a measure of normality to the Federation , Europe , and the world in general .\\nAs Bob Dylan has the gangster Joey Gallo say in his eponymous ballad : “ It ’ s peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again.\\n” At any other time , developments on this scale , and of this importance , would be dominating our headlines and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world would be following the advance of their forces with bated breath .\\nOnly time will tell whether the Western World ’ s utter distraction by the death of Queen Elizabeth II , and the accession of King Charles III , was a help or a hindrance to the Ukrainian offensive .\\nIt is , however , possible that the Queen ’ s death , by distracting the West , prevented its more hawkish leaders from making the sort of accusations and threats that only ever end up strengthening Putin ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armies racked up their victories while the eyes of the West were elsewhere , may yet prove to have been the most extraordinary stroke of good luck .\\nBy dying when she did , the Queen may well have saved the life of that sandal-wearing Russian greybeard , as well as tens-of-thousands of equally ill-equipped and poorly-trained Russian troops , and given the Armed Forces of Ukraine the clear airwaves they needed to drive Putin ’ s armies back across the border .\\nGoebbel ’ s Volkssturm could nor rescue the Third Reich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peoples Storm ” ( with a little help from the Americans ) has made it possible for Ukraine to lay waste the fondest hopes of Vladimir Putin – and his allies in Beijing .',\n",

       "  'content': 'There are quick fixes ( existing housing for emergency housing ) and longer term fixes ( building housing ) , both are needed , and there are tourism and immigration impacts .\\nFirstly , focus our scarce building resources on building affordable housing .\\nA focus will help bring down the price to build .\\nSo remove government supports for private demand for building resources i.e .\\n• Remove interest deductibility for tax on ‘ build to rent ’ businesses .\\nThis brings them into line with other rentals , so they have to stand on their own two feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ability of developers to bully build up to 6 stories in our historic green residential suburbs .\\nWhy ?\\nPrivate enterprise builds housing ; but to survive they must maximise profit .\\nIf a price is high , as currently for housing , they will work to keep the price high as that will maximise profits e.g .\\nthe rental market in Wellington has hundreds of rentals available but empty .\\nThis helps retain high rents on their active rentals elsewhere .\\nThere aren ’ t cheaper options for existing renters to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Housing sales also follows same techniques to maximise profits even though the market is down .\\nNote : With housing values dropping are we getting affordable housing ?\\nReal Estate Institute reports the national median house price for August 22 was $ 800,000 .\\nAnd the median hourly wage from Stats NZ for June 22 was $ 29.66 — so x 40 = $ 1,186.40 a week , x 52 = $ 61,692.80 for a projected median annual salary .\\nHouses used to be 5 times the salary .\\nSo for there to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ median price for a house should $ 308,464 .\\nGet real , this is way off being affordable .\\nThe best you can hope for with these prices is a crushing mortgage for the rest of your natural life .\\nSay goodbye to having children .\\nWe are still in the thick of a housing affordability crisis despite dropping prices .\\nSecondly , because it is a crisis you must also suppress excess demand on our limited supply of housing .\\n• Turn tourism down a bit .\\nThe short term rental market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AirBNB .\\n• A targeted tax on short term rentals that are in houses .\\n( apartments ? )\\n.\\nThis can be policed as they must advertise .\\nWith emergency housing using motels , where are tourists going to stay ?\\nFreedom camp ?\\nJust as Government is trying to clamp down on it .\\nIt raises the question , is there co-ordination .\\nPeople want to be near existing services , ( shops , entertainments , social services ) transport .\\nThis saves on new infrastructure costs , like light rail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the affordable housing crisis .\\nIn Wellington build affordable housing over retail car parks , and near or over train station car parks ( sound proof them ) on Hutt and Porirua lines .\\nE.g .\\nKilbirnie Pack n Save has a large north west facing carpark with lots of sun and views .\\nCountdown across the road .\\nOver J ’ ville Mall carpark .\\nCroften Downs ( but no others are suitable on J/ville line ) .\\nTe Aro is full of asphalt car parks .\\nIn Auckland build affordable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stations .\\nSo much retail and semi industrial could be accommodated under housing ( not all stations are suitable if they shade or overbear too many ) .\\nSylvia Park has huge capacity for affordable housing .\\nGreat views on that line and you ’ re not destroying the suburbs or your voters .\\nOnehunga Line , create an extra rail line beside the existing lines and extend it to the airport with much fewer stops so its a faster train ( large cost but can be done with Public Works Act ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system and adds more value to the recent extension for the City Rail Link .\\nBut Government must change zoning laws to allow residential to be linked to retail and transport , so down the lifts and you ’ re in the shops and transport .\\nWhat businesses lose they gain in customer proximity .\\nUse the power of government to bend a few private business owners .\\nDon ’ t delegate your power so others can bully your voters .\\nFourthly , what to build is mid rises ( 5 to 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of housing needed and gained for the effort .\\nChina ’ s building downturn means there is huge building capacity available now .\\n( Having seen You Tube clips , perhaps we do the foundations and finishing — which would speed up building more ) .\\nI suggest China because the crisis is urgent and very real and they are a major trading partner .\\nThere are obviously political considerations .\\nFifthly , existing housing stock must be fully used .\\nGovernment needs to get hold of houses urgently for emergency housing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for building .\\n• Ghost houses .\\nEither seize these houses under the Public Works Act or create an instrument so they are repaired to an excellent standard for emergency housing .\\nThe cost to do this becomes a loan to the owner of the house with interest .\\nIf not fully repaid to the government at the time of sale , the balance is recovered at that point .\\nGovt accounts balance with an asset , the loan .\\n• A legal requirement to rent out your rental or a large charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces the market down and will positively impact even existing customers as they could move .\\n• Change tax rules so no tax loss on ‘ a ’ rental is allowed .\\nThen no advantage in having a property empty to offset to other rentals .\\n• GV sale offers to rental owners looks good in this market .\\nIf they sell the consideration is some sort of 10 year government bond/instrument ( owning a house was a long term investment , so the bond is long ) .\\nGovernment then pays back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if the person was getting rental income .\\nThis means the money doesn ’ t just pour out of the government and keeps a continuity for the person .\\nThere are many more ideas than this .\\nWith the building resources focused government can more cheaply contract with builders .\\nOnce built they can sell apartments at cost to first home buyers or for a small profit .\\nSome must be used for emergency housing .\\nContract to build at minimum 100,000 apartments in mid rises .\\nThe urgent need is 30,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others living in the areas so ghettoes are not formed .\\nUsing exisiting housing will help and these newer houses will bring down prices .\\nSixth , wake up centrist Labour and Greens and use the power of government to build affordable housing for all first home buyers .\\nNot to delegate your powers to private developers to bully build over your voters so they don ’ t vote for you .\\nCooperation and pandering to National has not blunted their criticism .\\nThis is your crisis and you are bungling it .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ because , only the government can build affordable housing .\\np.s .\\nStuff , has not taken up the option to publish this or other articles about affordable housing .\\nThey do seem to more readily publish articles pro intensification and bully building .',\n",

       "  'content': 'IT MUST BE TWENTY YEARS since a bunch of well-meaning Pakeha attempted to hold a serious constitutional conference .\\nRepublicanism , a topic making a comeback following the death of Queen Elizabeth II , was on this long-ago gathering ’ s agenda , but so , too , was the Treaty of Waitangi .\\nThat was the problem .\\nOnce the Māori nationalists had laid down the wero of incorporating the Māori version of the Treaty into a reformed New Zealand constitution , the conference was over .\\nAs arranged , the good and the great delivered their thoughts on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ s ramshackle constitution , but nobody was really listening .\\nEverybody understood that te Tiriti o Waitangi , if accepted as the true constitutional blueprint of New Zealand , would act like the most powerful acid on the institutions and principles of the colonial state .\\nThose attending the conference also understood that the Māori nationalist position was effectively non-negotiable .\\nAll future deviations from the constitutional status-quowould be in the direction indicated by the Māori nationalists and their Pakeha enablers in the judiciary , academia , the public service , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ – the mainstream media .\\nIn their heart-of-hearts , the Pakeha conference organisers understood that , henceforth , constitutional reform in New Zealand could only be a matter of the slow and incremental advance of te Tiriti to the heart of the New Zealand state .\\nThis transformation would be accomplished without the widespread popular debate , or validating public referenda , generally considered essential to the making of new constitutions .\\nIndeed , it was clear that any te Tiriti-based transformation could only be accomplished by subterfuge , and only resisted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naïve republicans , therefore , the Queen ’ s death was an event to be feared : inevitable , but fraught with danger .\\nThe Māori Party ’ s recent ideological shift from monarchism to republicanism signalled the growing confidence of the Māori nationalist cause .\\nThe Crown has lost its magic .\\nThe cosy relationship between the House of Windsor and the Kingitanga – which the Prime Minister is desperately trying to shore up by taking King Tuheitia with her to the Queen ’ s funeral – is as unlikely to withstand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Zealand as the “ Settler State ” itself .\\nWith their Green Party enablers adding their voices to the Māori Party ’ s call for the indigenisation of the New Zealand constitution – a process which would begin with the repudiation of the name “ New Zealand ” in favour of “ Aotearoa ” – and Labour ’ s Māori Caucus determined not to be outflanked on the left by their Māori Party challengers , the Labour Party will find it increasingly difficult to maintain the position that the republican “ conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later date .\\nThat said , the radical agenda of the Māori nationalists will not be without its opponents .\\nQuite how the Kingitanga is supposed to retain any vestige of ideological credibility in an Aotearoa shaped by the requirements of comprehensive decolonisation is a question bound to create serious division .\\nWithout the presence of the British Crown , the Māori Crown may strike the radicals as an embarrassing exercise in colonial emulation .\\nThe Māori King and his subjects are unlikely to take kindly to such an insulting characterisation .\\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respond with growing alarm to the radicalism inherent in the Māori and Green parties ’ decolonisation and indigenisation agenda .\\nThe curious blending of aristocracy and capitalism that has grown up under the auspices of the Crown owes very little to the poverty-stricken Māori masses living in the major cities .\\nIndeed , the blending of traditional Māori leadership with corporate capitalism , was the Crown ’ s inspired solution to the dangerous political potential of the uprooted urban Māori population .\\n( Those with a working knowledge of Scottish history will recognise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transformation of traditional clan chiefs into modern capitalist landlords that followed the final defeat of the Jacobite cause in 1745 . )\\nThe Māori Party , the Greens , and the Labour Māori Caucus may soon find their radical constitutional plans opposed by an alliance of Māori and Pakeha forces that traverses Left and Right .\\nIncluded in the opposition , the tertiary-educated and largely middle-class Māori and Pakeha radicals may find not only those Māori who identify primarily as New Zealanders ( the nearly half of Maoridom who opt to go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very poorest and most marginalised Māori .\\nYoung Māori , tertiary qualified , fluent in Te Reo , and earning a six-figure salary from a government agency , may find that they are not received all that warmly by Māori who are crammed into motels , micro-managed by MSD , forced to work for the minimum wage at jobs that don ’ t pay the rent , and then made to feel worthless on account of their inability to speak their own language , feed their families , or make sure their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are powerful markers of identity – but so , too , is socio-economic status .\\nSo is class .\\nThe ultimate irony of a radical Māori nationalist push for republicanism would be an answering surge towards monarchical institutions .\\nA Māori-Pakeha alliance forged between members of the Professional-Managerial Class in pursuit of a radically identarian republic may yet find itself opposed by a Māori-Pakeha alliance embracing all social classes and dedicated to installing not one , but two , monarchs over New Zealand .\\nTheir unifying slogan , harking all the way back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1850s , could well be : “ King Charles III in his place , King Tuheitia in his , and the Treaty of Waitangi over them both.\\n” It is not difficult to imagine the said King Charles , and King Tuheitia , at Turangawaewae , jointly signing a new covenant , in which the common rights and privileges of all New Zealanders , and the resources and treasures of both its peoples , are reaffirmed , protected and guaranteed by the two Crowns , and the democratically elected bi-cameralparliament , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The radical , Māori nationalist drive towards a te Tiriti-driven , identarian republican constitution , written to advance the interests of both the Māori and the Pakeha members of the Professional-Managerial Class , may end up driving the traditional defenders of capitalism , liberal democracy , and the rights and aspirations of working people , into a set of constitutional arrangements as odd as they are innovative .\\nRadical , identarian republicanism may yet make royalists of us all .',\n",

       "  'content': 'As voting packs arrive in the mail , progressive voters in Auckland now face a tough choice in the contest for Mayor : should they hold their nose and vote for socially conservative Efeso Collins , backed by Labour and the Greens , or support the ‘ independent ’ bid of socially liberal but right-leaning Wayne Brown ?\\nCall me predictable , but I think their stance on cannabis reform is a bellwether issue .\\nIt shows what they really think about much more than just cannabis , and how their thinking is organised .\\nConservatism here , while professing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues , should be serious cause for concern .\\nIt could be a sign of muddled thinking , or appealing to base instincts to “ lock ‘ em up ” , or they could be beholden to vested interests or may be letting their religion get in the way .\\nCertainly , worth scrutinising further as we decide who should lead Aotearoa New Zealand ’ s largest city .\\nAuckland voters are ready for reform , with significant chucks of the city going green during the cannabis referendum – especially the diverse central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all the Māori seats .\\nLocal laws and approaches to drugs are possible .\\nWe already have local liquor licensing and different models in parts of the city , with West Auckland and Mt Wellington operating trusts which must return profits to the community .\\nAuckland Council already has a Psychoactive Substances Local Approved Products Policy , and – once the supermarkets back off – it will have a Local Alcohol Policy .\\nLocal councils can also petition central government to pass local laws which affect only their area ( an obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Council , or the recent law for Tamaki housing intensification ) .\\nAuckland Council could design a Local Cannabis Policy which could , for example , create trusts like the liquor trusts in West Auckland , or designate safe consumption spaces giving police clear rules about who they should not be targeting .\\nThis is all possible – and especially so with a supportive mayor .\\nI was at Auckland University with Efeso Collins in the early 90 ’ s .\\nHe was part of a clique who took an intense dislike to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elected as Student Union president he made the area smokefree , took away the Upper Common Room safe space for cannabis consumers , and oversaw a reversal of AUSA policy so it no longer supported cannabis legalisation – a position it had held since the 1960 ’ s .\\nIt was obvious even back then that Efeso came from a conservative , religious , background and he held those beliefs deeply .\\nAs he has every right to .\\nBut fast forward 25 years to the cannabis referendum in 2020 , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Efeso strongly advocated for the Nope campaign , with public speaking , appearing on Christian panels , and media appearances including Q & A .\\nEfeso wasn ’ t a bit player in the Nope campaign , he was a main star .\\nAnd it turned out that in those intervening years he had campaigned against marriage equality and abortion reform .\\nI ’ m reluctant to give him any credit for Nope ’ s narrow win .\\nBut Efeso ’ s predictions of doom , and appeals to liberal guilt , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nIn the end that ’ s all it took , with the difference being a mere 37,000 voters going the other way .\\nAfter going hard for Nope , and after the result was declared , Efeso said he would have supported decriminalisation .\\nIf only he had said that at the time !\\nBut credit where credit is due , at least Collins does support decriminalisation – confirmed by Family First .\\nAnd he claims to have apologised for what he describes as his previous stance against marriage equality and abortion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he had said .\\nIn fact , at a recent forum organised by the Karangahape Business Association , all the leading candidates expressed support for cannabis law reform .\\nQuizzed by moderator Russell Brown about his opposition to the cannabis referendum , Collins said he would support decriminalising cannabis but couldn ’ t back legalisation due to what he said was the damage he had seen in young people .\\nAt the same forum Wayne Brown was reported as winning the crowd ’ s favour with his clear support for making cannabis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scourge on the community .\\nBrown calls himself socially liberal but fiscally conservative .\\nHe voted Yes .\\nI really don ’ t know much more than that .\\nBut I like a candidate who backs legalisation and I suspect he could find a way to make it happen .\\nBut of course , candidates have positions on a myriad of issues and , despite me saying their stance on cannabis is a bellweather which informs voters of their true character , there are lots of things progressives may consider when casting their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cast your vote .\\nLast time we had a pathetic 35 % turn out , dominated by conservatives and older/elderly voters who get to decide how our city is run .\\nAs our dear editor Martyn Bradbury would say : Fuck .\\nThat .\\nSo , roll up and vote .\\nPro tip – voting is even better when you ’ re high !\\nElsewhere , my good friend and former Green MP , Nandor Tanczos is running for mayor of Whakatane where he has been councillor for six years .\\nPlease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there to vote Nandor for Mayor .\\nIf you ’ re already enrolled your voting pack should have arrived or will do soon .\\nPost your vote back by 8 October .\\nEnrol at vote.nz or call 0800 36 76 56 now .\\nChris Fowlie is the president of the National Organisation for the Reform of Marijuana Laws NZ

       "  'content': 'At a press conference September 21 the chair of the US Federal Reserve Jerome Powell said that that the “ economic pain ” being felt as the economy slowed would be continued for “ how long it takes to bring wages down ” before trying to correct his political admission of the Feds priority target by adding “ and more importantly for prices to come down.\\n” He identified the pain arising from higher mortgage rates as the “ housing market weakened considerably ” .\\nBusiness investment and exports were also declining .\\nBut the real enemy remained working people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowdown in growth , the labour market has remained tight , with the unemployment rate near a 50-year low , job vacancies near historical highs , and wage growth elevated.\\n” Moreover , in both the US and NZ it is simply a lie that inflation was caused by low unemployment or high wages when it is clear to everyone that prices are rising at a rate much higher than the increase in wage rates in both countries .\\nThe US Fed and the RBNZ were in fact the central creators of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excess of demand to confront the Covid crisis .\\nThey know that and simply lie to evade responsibility .\\nCapitalist economic theory has no scientific evidence to support its claims .\\nWhat they have is a series of rationalisations to pursue an economic and social policy that permanently enriches the already rich at the expense of working people .\\nWhat the bosses hate about low unemployment is that it empowers working people in the “ job market ” .\\nDuring periods of low unemployment workers individually and collectively have more power .\\nIndividually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shove it he doesn ’ t pay more or treat them with respect .\\nCollectively they can join unions and strike for better pay and conditions without the threat of being sacked as much of a threat as it would be with higher unemployment .\\nThat is also why the bosses love to have access to the world labour market by bringing in workers with fewer rights than NZ-resident workers have to keep wages as low as possible .\\nThat is why pre-Covid we had 300,000 workers on temporary visas – over 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent decades we never have had a period of low unemployment when the “ labour market ” like any market was allowed to work properly .\\nFor example , you need periods of low unemployment to improve margins for skills to what the actual costs are to get those skills .\\nThat is why New Zealand is so desperately short of skilled labour .\\nThe free-market theorists manipulated the free market for labour to prevent it from functioning properly .\\nThey made up a dogma called the Natural Rate of Unemployment which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justify their views .\\nThe previous period of high inflation in the 1970s was also a period of widespread working-class activity to defend wages against inflation .\\nMillions joined unions and took action across the globe .\\nIn New Zealand , there was a record level of strike action and two general strikes .\\nThis resulted in real wages – the real value of wages peaked in the early 1980s despite inflation and union membership hitting over 50 % of the workforce .\\nInflation in the 1970s was caused by huge government budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finance their wars abroad and the welfare programmes needed at home to maintain social peace following the explosive growth of the civil rights movement that swept the country at that time .\\nSo it suited the deeply anti-working class economic theorists at that time to try to blame working people for inflation and use unemployment to try and smash the institutions of the working class like trade unions to force back real wages .\\nThe man appointed to Chair the US Fed in 1979 simply declared : “ The standard of living of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” in 1982 as he pushed the US Fed rate up to 20 % with an economic shock therapy that saw official unemployment hit 10 % and unions smashed by the government of US President Reagan .\\nIt is that same programme that was carried out in New Zealand by both the Labour-led government from 1984-1990 and the National-led government that followed .\\nUnion members today are barely 20 % of the workforce and 10 % of the private sector .\\nBut the tiniest signs of workers getting some bargaining power are denounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank as “ unsustainable ” and they are willing to impose an economic recession to fix that problem .\\nThere are alternative policies that can be carried out but they involve breaking with the capitalist status quo .\\nTo start with we need to put the banking system under public control and put money creation under a democratic plan .\\nInterest rates can then be kept low for homeowners and small businesses and not used to enrich the financial oligarchy that owns and controls the banks in Aotearoa today .\\nIt means giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a reduction in the working week if needed with no loss in pay to share the jobs around .\\nIt means a massive increase in taxes on the very rich so that all the social spending needed in health and education can be done in a non-inflationary manner .\\nThe working class majority needs to call the shots through a government that serves their needs above those of the 1 % calling the shots today .',\n",

       "  'content': 'A GOOD TELEVISION SERIES can alter the way people view the world .\\nFifty years from now , people will still be drawing lessons from Game of Thrones .\\nSimilarly inspired , I continue to draw lessons from a British television series first screened in 1971 , The Guardians .\\nThe “ Guardians of the Realm ” were the paramilitary force set up to enforce the will an authoritarian British government .\\nConfronted with a rapidly disintegrating United Kingdom , shadowy forces , headed by “ The General ” , had seized power and established a dictatorial regime .\\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , responded with a campaign of assassination and terror .\\nLike Game of Thrones , The Guardians is not light viewing .\\nOne episode of The Guardians , in particular , left me forever alert to the cynical use of religion as a political weapon .\\nNot entirely happy with the way things are going in the Guardians ’ new UK , the CIA sets up a weird religious movement through which it plans to influence public opinion .\\nGiven what has happened in the years since The Guardians first screened , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the series , Rex Firkin and Vincent Tilsley , had been talking to .\\nCertainly , radical religious movements were frequently to be found buttressing the authoritarian regimes installed by the CIA throughout the 1970s and 80s – especially those whose primary function had been to forestall , or destroy , left-wing governments attracting dangerous levels of popular support .\\nThis was especially the case in Latin America where the Christian socialism of “ Liberation Theology ” , espoused by a growing number of Catholic priests and prelates , was attracting a growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nThe ascension of the vehemently anti-communist Polish cardinal , Carol Wojtyla , as Pope John-Paul II , in 1979 , served – for a while – to stem the spread of Liberation Theology across the Catholic lands .\\nFor those responsible for preserving the global hegemony of the United States , however , Catholic Christianity would always be unsound .\\nPopes come and go , but Christ ’ s “ preferential option for the poor ” endures as an unacceptable challenge to the American imperium .\\nThe religious expression weaponised by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home and abroad , evangelicalism became an extraordinarily potent rejoinder to the latent socialism embedded in the Christian gospel .\\nWhere the Catholic Church preached a theology of atonement and imitation , radical Protestantism promised rebirth and redemption without the need for good works .\\n“ Born again ” , the evangelicals could come before God pre-forgiven and debt-free .\\nIn combination with the emotional intensity of its services , evangelicalism ’ s guarantee of salvation constituted a compelling sales pitch .\\nCatholicism ’ s insistence on confession and penance put them at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could keep an evangelical from God ’ s eternal company : socialism , abortion , and homosexuality .\\nProviding the believer eschewed these three affronts to the Almighty , his or her salvation was assured .\\nWhat ’ s more , evangelical congregations numbering in the thousands were able to give worshippers extremely powerful emotional experiences .\\nThey were also large enough to fund comprehensive welfare services to members in need .\\nWho needed socialism when you had your church ?\\nBesides , Jesus wasn ’ t so much a friend of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provident .\\nNor was he the enemy of the rich .\\nEvangelicals were encouraged to see the accumulation of great personal wealth as a sign of God ’ s approbation .\\nAfter all , what sort of incentive to Godliness is poverty ?\\nHaving just logged-on to the Brazilian Electoral Commission ’ s website , the practical effect of this slow but steady spread of evangelicalism across Latin America is staring me in the face .\\nWith 99.9 percent of the votes counted , the Socialist candidate , Lula , has fallen agonisingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the popular vote he needed to avoid a second round against the far-right ( and recently baptised evangelical Christian ) Jair Bolsonaro .\\nHad the religious demographics of the states of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo remained what they had been when Lula first won the Brazilian presidency back in 2003 , it is likely they would have delivered him the votes he needed to win .\\nWith the help of the much increased and increasingly pivotal evangelical vote , however , both states fell to Bolsonaro by wide margins .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ conspiracy theorist to see in the bloody alliance of Latin American dictators , reactionary Catholics and fanatically anti-communist evangelical protestants a political combination of enormous utility to the United States .\\nAs New Zealanders , inhabitants of one of the most secular societies on earth , we find it difficult to grasp the centrality of religious belief to the politics of Latin America .\\nNevertheless , we need to understand that the tactics of the CIA-backed anti-insurgents of the 1970s and 80s were born out of what lay about them .\\nIf hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a religious faith ready and willing to wash them clean .\\nDid the creators of The Guardians intuitively grasp the political utility of religious extremism , or did somebody they met in a bar tell them ?\\nThe early 1970s were a dangerous and dubious time .\\nShadowy figures gathered in great houses and plotted coups .\\nAssassination and terrorism filled the headlines .\\nCertainly , it was no accident that the network broadcasting The Guardians , ITV , decided that it was all just a little too close to home @ @ @ @ @ @ @',\n",

       "  'content': 'ABOLISH STREAMING , that is the demand of the Post-Primary Teachers Association ( PPTA ) .\\nThey are not alone in their determination to put an end to the “ blatantly racist ” practice of grouping secondary-school students according to their intelligence/academic ability .\\nThe Minister of Education , Chris Hipkins , considers streaming “ inequitable ” and the Ministry of Education agrees with him .\\nWith forces as powerful as the Minister , the Ministry , and the Union ranged against the practice , its days would appear to be numbered .\\nWhich just leaves New Zealanders with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streaming is no more ?\\nWill their children emerge from the public education system with the skills and qualifications necessary to foot-it in the modern world ?\\nOr , will their education be limited to whatever the least engaged and least talented students allow their teachers to impart ?\\nIf that is the outcome , then all the opponents of streaming will have achieved by its elimination is a society managed by traditionally-educated immigrants equipped with all the internationally recognised skills and qualifications that young , publicly-educated New Zealanders no longer possess .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abolition of streaming in the public secondary system will not make New Zealand a more equitable nation .\\nNo more than the students themselves , will parents be fooled by the randomised mixing of individuals of radically different abilities .\\nThe mums and dads of highly intelligent and powerfully motivated children will do everything within their power to ensure that their offspring are pushed and extended to the fullest extent of their powers .\\nIf they can not get this from the public sector , then they will turn to private providers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not end in a narrowing of the class and racial divides , it will drive them wider apart .\\nMāori middle-class parents will be as keen to see their offspring extended as middle-class Pākehā parents .\\nThose who can not afford the $ 30,000 per year fees of the leading private schools , will do all within their power to move their families into the zones of the most prestigious public schools , where the strong class bias of the “ good schools ’ ” catchments will lessen the impact of streaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are well aware that as diversity quotas are achieved , and the need for positive discrimination declines , social advancement will increasingly depend on having the right credentials .\\nThough they can hardly come out and say so , the drive towards racial equity – of which the abolition of streaming is part – is not in their own children ’ s interests .\\nThere is , after all , a very powerful justification for streaming .\\nHighly-complex , technologically-sophisticated civilisations , based on science , simply can not do without the rigid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nThe streaming process is , therefore , absolutely critical to the social and intellectual winnowing required to concentrate and develop talent .\\nStreaming isn ’ t just about grouping the smartest students together , it ’ s about acculturating the smartest students to smart .\\nStreaming encourages students to value and accept their larger capabilities .\\nIn a non-streamed environment , the pressure is inevitably towards the mean – in every sense of the word .\\nThe supposed downside of this meritocratic imperative is its negative impact upon those of lesser competence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jibe at the very notion of hierarchies .\\nThey tell themselves that they are egalitarians , and fool themselves into thinking that egalitarianism means every person is the same as every other person – even when they know it isn ’ t true .\\n( Just ask them if they would select an All Black team on that basis ! )\\nNew Zealanders have forgotten that their public education system was not conceived as an environment in which every student gets an “ A ” , but as a place where every kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receives the professional instruction and educational resources he or she needs to be awarded an “ A ” .\\nIt should not matter whether you ’ re Māori or Pākehā , rich or poor , male or female , gay or straight : if you ’ ve got the talent , then you should be equipped to go as far as it can take you .\\nAnd if getting “ As ” in academic disciplines isn ’ t your thing , then the education system ’ s job is to find out what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fullest extent .\\nThat is what Charles Beeby and Peter Fraser meant when they together defined the education policy of the First Labour Government : “ The government ’ s objective , broadly expressed , is that every person , whatever his level of academic ability , whether he be rich or poor , whether he live in town or country , has a right , as a citizen , to a free education of the kind for which he is best fitted , and to the fullest extent of his powers.\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the masculine pronoun , the phrase that sticks most in the craw of twenty-first century educators is : “ for which he is best fitted ” .\\nThe PPTA ’ s argument is that the cultural logic of colonisation leads racist Pakeha teachers to the view that Māori and Pasifika are “ best fitted ” to be hewers of wood and drawers of water : a stereotype into which , for the rest of their time in secondary school , the system will do its best to transform them .\\nGet rid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that evil colonial project is made much more difficult .\\nExcept , of course , transforming secondary school classes into random collections of students of every colour from every background is , itself , a pipe dream .\\nDifferent races and different classes live in different places .\\nGetting rid of streaming at Auckland Grammar will look quite different from getting rid of streaming at Northland College .\\nAnd even if the Ministry of Education could magically produce perfectly random collections of students ( much as the US Supreme Court tried to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of town to the other ) the Bell Curve would still not be denied – only those kids at either end of it .\\nIt is a matter for considerable regret that the PPTA , in its determination to overcome the effects of colonisation , shows every sign of establishing a new regime where the “ soft bigotry of low expectations ” will only end up making the racist outcomes worse .',\n",

       "  'content': 'SO , HOW DOES IT WORK ?\\nAt every level , on every subject , the same explanation is offered for Māori disadvantage – colonisation .\\nWhat ’ s more , the word itself has acquired such a talismanic quality that its mere utterance is sufficient to close down any further discussion .\\nAfter all , the only people likely to challenge the colonisation explanation for Māori disadvantage would be the colonisers ’ descendants themselves .\\nAnd they would say that – wouldn ’ t they ?\\nThe colonisers ’ descendants might also raise the question as to whether Māori @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all .\\nNot a question that anyone would have thought to raise fifty years ago .\\nIn the 1970s the argument that Māori had not been colonised would have been laughed out of court .\\nBack then it was generally assumed that , under the terms of the Treaty of Waitangi , Māori had ceded sovereignty to the British Crown .\\nWhat ’ s more , the British , very soon after the signing of the Treaty , exercised their sovereignty by annexing New Zealand , declaring it a British colony , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh yes , the Māori had been colonised alright – they ’ d been colonised good and proper .\\nBut , fifty years later , the story has changed .\\nToday we are enjoined to believe that the Māori chiefs gathered at Waitangi on 6 February 1840 did not cede sovereignty to Queen Victoria .\\nIndeed , no less a body than the Waitangi Tribunal has declared that the sovereignty of Māori iwi and hapu remains intact to this day .\\nIt is a curious sort of coloniser who , 180 years after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the indigenous inhabitants of the islands his ancestors claimed as their own .\\nIf the indigenous people of New Zealand were not subjugated by military force , relieved of their lands , forests and fisheries , and pushed to the margins of colonial society , then what was going on between the 1850s and the 1970s ?\\nIn the most brutal and unvarnished terms , what was going on between the signing of the Treaty and the military suppression of all Māori resistance in the 1860s and 70s , was a deliberate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settling tens-of-thousands of immigrants across the country , to the point where their numerical superiority rendered the construction of a second Britain in the South Pacific a feasible proposition .\\nWhat made “ New Zealand ” possible was the reduction of the Māori to a militarily and politically powerless minority in their own land .\\nA particular kind of colonisation , then ?\\nNot at all the same as the colonisation visited upon India and Africa .\\nNot even the same as the colonisation visited upon England and Ireland by the Normans .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ small number of conquerors and a very much larger number of conquered .\\nHundreds-of-millions of Indians were ruled over by around 100,000 British soldiers and administrators .\\nThe sort of colonisation which colonised peoples can dismantle – which is pretty much what they spent the second half of the twentieth century doing .\\nBut , the Anglo-Saxon colonies of North America and Australasia were a very different proposition .\\nIn a relatively short period of time the indigenous peoples of those lands were reduced to insignificant minorities by an unceasing flood of settlers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers rendered military resistance futile .\\nAlways there were more , and more , and more Europeans to replace the settlers and soldiers killed by the indigenous tribes .\\nNorth America and Australasia thus became “ Neo-Europes ” , ruled over and overwhelmingly populated by Europeans .\\nIndigenous cultures : their languages , customs , modes of political and economic organisation ; even where they escaped becoming the victims of outright genocide , found themselves smothered by the sheer pressure of European numbers .\\nis the process which Māori , along with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Neo-Europes created by Americans , Canadians , Australians and New Zealanders , call “ colonisation ” .\\nThe cultural suffocation that inevitably attended the submerging of indigenous peoples beneath a relentlessly rising tide of nineteenth century immigrants .\\nSettlers who came to stay – and who , more than a century later , are still there .\\nWithin the institutions of the state , and even in a number of private organisations , the answer to colonisation is being presented as “ decolonisation ” and “ indigenisation ” .\\nAs if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life can be re-configured to the point of somehow undoing the facts of New Zealand history .\\nRegrettably , this strategy carries within it a distressing element of coercion .\\nThe threat is there , all the more daunting for being unstated , that those who refuse to decolonise and indigenise will pay a price .\\nGiven the degree of coercion involved in colonisation itself , this hard-line approach is entirely understandable .\\nUnfortunately , it is also likely to provoke the colonisers ’ descendants into adopting an angry oppositional stance , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is almost certain to be counterproductive .\\nAttempting to undercut “ the tyranny of the majority ” by unilaterally redefining the meaning of democracy will only make things worse .\\nThe decolonising concept of “ co-governance ” can not succeed if it is understood by Pākehā to mean that Māori will be empowered to exercise a right of veto over the delivery of essential state services mostly paid for by Pākehā taxes .\\nEuropean cultural traditions and political norms are simply too deeply embedded in the Neo-Europe called New Zealand for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past and overcoming the inequities of the present to succeed .\\nMuch more likely to secure Pākehā support is the argument that , in the making of New Zealand far too little concern was shown for the impact the colonists ’ nation-building was having on the lives and treasures of Māori iwi and hapu .\\nIn their eagerness to create a second Britain in the South Pacific , the colonisers simply crowded-out the indigenous people whose rights they were pledged to respect .\\nPresenting co-governance as a way of encouraging Māori to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance of success .\\nThat the colonial state smothered and suffocated Māori culture and Māori rights is historically undeniable , and morally indefensible .\\nCeding Māori the space they need to both rediscover and redefine their tino rangatiratanga is unquestionably the right thing for Pākehā to do .\\nEncouraging Pākehā to join them in that expanded space is unquestionably the best way for Māori to make Aotearoa less European and more indigenous .\\nDecolonisation is not a programme to be imposed , it is a skill that Māori and Pākehā can only acquire @ @',\n",

       "  'content': 'The Government ’ s media response to the Ministry of Social Development ( MSD ) Child Poverty Report 2022 proudly claims “ Child poverty declines in spite of COVID ” .\\nSure , material hardship rates for many children improved between 2013-21 , thanks to government measures , rising employment rates , improving wages .\\nBUT the MSD report itself is at pains to say that these results do not reflect anything like the full extent of the pandemic period .\\nLet ’ s not forget too , the huge efforts of the proliferating private charities and foodbanks , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicator of policy failure .\\n• None Government policy means child poverty measures improve during COVID-19 in contrast to them rising sharply during the GFC .\\n• None There are 145,000 fewer children in hardship in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic than when hardship numbers peaked after the GFC in 2011 .\\n• None There were 70,000 more jobless households with children during and immediately after the GFC then during COVID-19 .\\n• None Rates of hardship for Māori rose to 36 % after the GFC , and 47 % for Pacific people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % and 24 % respectively .\\nThis means there are 40,000 fewer Māori children in poverty now than there were after the GFC .\\n• None Around the GFC ( 2007 to 2011 ) less than 40 % of households with children said they had enough income to cover the basics .\\nThis is now 61 % .\\nThat ’ s 150,000 more households who can meet their basic needs now There are no health warnings in the Government ’ s media release about how to interpret the data and the limitations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest MSD report was collected during the period July 2020 and June 2021 , with reference to the previous 12 months .\\nA family interviewed early in the piece would be reporting income for the 2019/2020 year .\\nSo much of the data is prior to the full Covid pandemic , and does not capture anything at all of the severe impact the 2021 lockdown had on low-income families , or the recent devastating cost of living pressures .\\nRemember too , thousands of worst-off children live in emergency accommodation such as motels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survey on which the child poverty report is based because their families have no residential address .\\nThe media release appears tone deaf to the intense pressures that private charities have been constantly reporting in 2022 , the thousands of children in damp , cold housing with blighted life trajectories , the crippling rent rises and the entrenchment of the foodbank industry on scale unimaginable to most New Zealanders .\\nThe claims on the one hand that child poverty has declined , and the on-the ground reports from those coping with the covid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other suggest the poverty indicators relied on in the Child Poverty Reduction Act are not fit for purpose in times of crisis .\\nThe government would be advised to pay close attention to what the report actually says .\\nEven though families on average appear to do better from 2013 , the report shows 120,000 children were still in hardship in the 2021 survey .\\nOf these , around 60,000 children were living in severe hardship ( and remember those in motels or other make do accommodation like garages were not in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months the resounding evidence from the NGO sector suggests that things have got much worse .\\nThere were no special measures in the devastating Auckland 2021 lockdown like a doubled winter energy payments for struggling families .\\nNor was there any cost-of-living payment recently for them either .\\nFoodbank use has soared .\\nNGO ’ s themselves are reporting burnout from the high demand And little light at the end of the tunnel .\\nIn April 2022 , well overdue inflation adjustments to WFF were woefully inadequate , while the fixed threshold and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were like the rats on a treadmill forced to pay for their own cheese .\\nThey see extra income earned over a low fixed threshold disappearing into tax , ( 17.5-30 % ) repayment of working for families ( 27 % ) loss of accommodation supplement ( 25 % ) and student loans ( 12 % ) .\\nWork it out- nothing to show for extra effort .\\nIt is good to see the MSD report say sternly that the claim ‘ work is the way out of poverty ’ is a nonsense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be congratulated on doing a great job of highlighting the dire living standards of the worst of children and their families .\\nThe average hardship measures disguise the full picture .\\nThere is a very interesting new feature in the MSD report that the disaggregates Auckland figures into 6 wards .\\nIt really matters that in the Southern wards ( Manukau and Manurewa-Papakura ) the rates of hardship for children at 28 % , rates of severe hardship at 13 % , and food bank use at 19 % are 2-2.5 times higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These wards have “ 24 % of Auckland ’ s under-18 population but 53 % of under-18 Aucklanders in material hardship ” says the report .\\nRather than comparing the child poverty rates of hardship of the global financial crisis of 14 years ago and telling themselves they have done better this time when the full impact of the pandemic has NOT YET been measured , government needs to better understand communities with widespread severe hardship and few resources to draw on .\\nThe incidence of serious disease like rheumatic fever , high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence , transience , youth crime , pupils leaving school too early because their families need them to earn money is having a dramatic scarring effect in poorer communities .\\nNew Zealand will pay a very high price in social fallout and be vastly the poorer for the under-investment in these young lives .\\nGoing back to the averages again , material hardship rates , that is going without six or more ‘ essential ’ items , are much higher for Maori and Pacific children than the rest of the population .\\nAround @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material hardship while the rate for Maori is one in three compared to the national average of one in ten .\\nAs well two-thirds of children in severe hardship are in a family affected by disability .\\nDavid McCormack , a cardiothoracic surgeon employed at Waikato Hospital by Te Whatu Ora ( Health New Zealand reports in Ian Powell ’ s New Zealand ’ s ‘ National Disgrace ’ : ‘ One Of The Worst Places To Bring Up A Child ’ | Scoop News : “ I had never treated rheumatic heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nThe grievous impact it has on young lives and whanau can not be overstated.It is a disease divided down racial lines in New Zealand – 93 % of cases present in Pasifika and Māori children .\\nPasifika children are admitted to hospital for rheumatic fever 140 times more often than children of “ European or other ” ethnicities , while Māori children were admitted 50 times more often .\\nOn average 140 people die from rheumatic heart disease each year .\\nRoughly 160 new cases are diagnosed a year but many cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Minister last week was “ While there is strong evidence in this report that things have been broadly improving for the worst off kids , I know there are still a core group of children in New Zealand that lead very hard lives and there is more work to do to fix that ” More work to do ?\\nHow long can these children be forced to wait- Labour has had five years .\\nIs there an emergency budget before Christmas ?\\nNow it seems that whatever is their next step it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they win the election .\\nThe MSD report identifies that beneficiaries are among the most impoverished people in our society .\\nThe rate of material hardship for the children of beneficiaries is around four to five times higher than the rate for children in ‘ working ’ households .\\nSo why does a sole parent , who may be trying to do paid work as well as having the full-time care of 2 or 3 children not qualify for the full Working or Families ?\\nDoes she really need a work incentive that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off a benefit , regardless of her circumstances or those of the children ?\\nWhy should her children be denied the poverty relief assistance that would make all the difference ?\\nWhy is the Working for Families Review taking so long ?\\nThe exclusion from the full WFF has had a cumulative effect on the balance sheets of families in low-income communities .\\nSince 2006 when the in work tax credit was introduced ( worth at least $ 72.50 for a family of 1-3 children and more for larger families ) the cumulative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in today ’ s dollars .\\nThe MSD report takes the unacceptable living standards of the poorest children very seriously indeed in its 200 pages of detailed analysis “ The analysis shows that for those children in the most materially deprived households ( ~5 to 8 % ) , life is undeniably very different from that experienced by the vast majority of New Zealand children .\\nThis finding is in line with what was found using similar indicators from the 2008 Living Standards Survey .\\nIt illustrates what it means in practice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of life in one ’ s own society ’ , the high-level definition of poverty commonly used for richer countries and adopted in MSD reports.\\n’ The government ’ s media response just doesn ’ t cut it .\\n“ Government initiatives like the Families Package , minimum wage increases , benefit increases , and Food in Schools have all contributed to reductions in poverty .\\n”',\n",

       "  'content': 'While Americans convicted for possessing pot will soon be pardoned , some local politicians have already stubbed out the roach here , citing the 2020 cannabis referendum result .\\nYet there remains a need to pardon Kiwis for something most of us no longer believe should be a crime , and there are several ways we could do it , writes CHRIS FOWLIE .\\nAs part of a three-point plan , US President Joe Biden announced an immediate and full pardon for everyone in the US federally convicted of “ simple possession ” of marijuana .\\n“ Sending people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many lives — for conduct that is legal in many states .\\nThat ’ s before you address the clear racial disparities around prosecution and conviction .\\nToday , we begin to right these wrongs , ” Biden tweeted .\\nIn addition to the pardon of all prior federal convictions , Biden also implored state legislatures and Governors to do the same thing – and that clear signal encouraging local reforms will have a huge impact for millions of Americans carrying state- and county-level convictions for pot .\\nThe biggest impact could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fewest headlines : Biden announced plans to review the scheduling of cannabis , which is currently lumped in with Heroin as having “ no medical value ” and the toughest of sanctions .\\nRescheduling cannabis would reduce or potentially eliminate penalties and would help remove blockages to research .\\nOf note , the review does not rule out fully descheduling cannabis , or removing it entirely from the Controlled Substances Act , and leaving states to make their own rules .\\nStatistics from NZ ’ s Ministry of Justice , quoted by One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2022 more than 100,000 people have been convicted of cannabis possession and/or use in New Zealand .\\nThe burden of these convictions is not shared evenly .\\nCannabis is used by people of all walks of life , but the well off and elite have typically avoided police attention and gotten better treatment if they are caught .\\nOn the other hand , according to a recent report by the Prime Minister ’ s chief science adviser Juliet Gerrard , Māori are three times more likely to be arrested and convicted for cannabis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher rates of use .\\nBut while welcoming the US move , Justice Minister Kiri Allen said New Zealand ’ s current laws are “ fit for purpose ” and the Government is sticking by its pledge to follow the referendum result .\\nGreen MP Chlöe Swarbrick said “ Even the most ardent opposition to cannabis legalisation argued it shouldn ’ t be a criminal offence .\\nNow even the birthplace of the “ War on Drugs ” is admitting they ’ ve failed.\\n” Health Minister Andrew Little , former Overseer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excuse for further inaction .\\na condescending lesson on New Zealand ’ s constitutional arrangements .\\n“ We don ’ t have the sort of executive powers that POTUS [ President of the United States ] has .\\nUnder our system of government ministers do not interfere in judicial decision-making .\\nParliament passes laws which judges apply.\\n” Well , that ’ s the point : Parliament has indeed passed laws criminalising hundreds of thousands of people , which the courts are applying and will continue to apply until Parliament does something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spokesperson Paul Goldsmith tried to end the discussion about pardoning pot convicts by saying cannabis legalisation should be “ off the table ” because of the referendum result .\\nACT ’ s David Seymour said he voted Yes in the referendum but he ’ s against pardoning New Zealanders “ for something that is still illegal ” .\\nBut as Swarbrick said , the “ highly specific ” referendum ’ s narrow result ( 50.7 percent in opposition ) should not rule out all progress , especially when even hardened campaigners for Nope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using cannabis .\\nWhy , oh Lorde , is Chlöe still the only one making any sense ?\\nIn the wake of the cannabis referendum , Labour pinned itself to doing nothing .\\nYet a very narrow vote on a specific piece of legislation should not be an excuse for inaction , for evermore .\\nThe 2019 amendment to the Misuse of Drugs Act .\\nwhich reminded police of their discretion to not prosecute use and possession “ unless it is required in the public interest ” .\\nhas resulted in much a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that .\\nHowever , disparities remain including racist enforcement and a geographical bias which sees Aucklanders arrested for cannabis possession at ten times the rate of Southlanders .\\nLocal researchers found that for Māori , “ there was no reduction in the number of cannabis charges before vs. after the amendment to cannabis laws ” .\\nRecent police researchalso found Māori are still over-represented in cannabis charges despite the 2019 law change giving police discretion over drug-related arrests .\\nIn the New Zealand context , cannabis pardons should cover more than just “ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convicted under Section 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act for procuring cannabis , and/or possession , and/or consuming it , smoking it , or otherwise using it .\\nPardon the lot .\\nThe pardon should also include convictions for cannabis utensils , which carry a heavier sentence and are often recorded on criminal records as “ possession of a needle or syringe ” – further blighting people ’ s records and employment prospects .\\nThere are several legal pathways to action a pot pardon .\\nThe Royal prerogative of mercy could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cases ( for example , everyone convicted of possession or use of cannabis and/or a cannabis utensil ) .\\nIn practise the Governor General acts on the instructions not of the King but of the Government of the day .\\nCabinet could write to the GG asking them to do this , and with a stroke of their golden pen – voila !\\n– It is done .\\nLegislation could be introduced directing the Ministry of Justice to wipe their records of convictions for possession of cannabis .\\nIt could be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill .\\nThis has been done before .\\nPeople with convictions for homosexuality are now able to apply to have them wiped .\\nParliament has also passed legislation to pardon soldiers executed in the Great War .\\nBut cannabis is still illegal , so that wouldn ’ t help those yet to be convicted in future .\\nA simple fix would be to amend the Misuse of Drugs Act section 7 to specify that offences against it ( use and possession etc ) shall not be recorded as criminal convictions .\\nA third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clean Slate Act so that it applies immediately to any convictions for use or possession of cannabis , rather than the usual 7 years of good behaviour and other criteria .\\nBiden implored state legislatures and Governors to wipe criminal records and has cleared a pathway for further law reform at the state level .\\nNew Zealand does not have local criminal records that could be wiped , but we can have local drug laws .\\nThe Government could take a leaf from Biden ’ s book and devolve cannabis law enforcement to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cannabis referendum show some areas are more than ready for legalisation , while others have more support for keeping the law the same .\\nWe already have local laws for alcohol .\\nSeveral regions have voted to retain licensing trusts , and the sale and supply of liquor is quite different in those places .\\nLocal Councils have their own Local Alcohol Policies , and Local Approved Product Policies for psychoactive substances .\\nAucklanders have their own unique Council structure , an Auckland-only fuel tax , and some may recall when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , Auckland Mayor Wayne Brown , I ’ m looking at you !\\nThis is exactly the sort of thing you can do if you want to .\\nPressure central government for local de jure laws such as the above , or de facto approaches using non-legislative methods .\\nLocal government could negotiate Memorandums of Understanding with their Police district about how they will operate .\\nSuch MOUs could detail the priorities expected by that local area ( ranking cannabis way down the list ) , how police are expected to behave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public interest in that area .\\nThey could specify that the public interest is not met by searching anyone for cannabis , nor raiding their home for it , nor responding to growing small amounts at home , nor proceeding with any prosecution for personal amounts .\\nThis could become a de facto decriminalisation in areas which showed strong majorities for Yes in the cannabis referendum : the main urban centres , West Auckland , Northland , East Cape , Nelson and the West Coast .\\nThe Māori electorates also all showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nCould changes to cannabis law enforcement be part of Te Tiriti redresses ?\\nHerbal cannabis is currently C1 – the toughest of the Class C subcategories , which come with special police search powers , and restrictions on medical use .\\nConcentrates made from cannabis , which may include dabs or hash but also cookies and vape cartridges , are classed as B1 which absurdly lumps it in with amphetamine and 25B-NBOMe .\\nAgain , B1 comes with tougher restrictions and more police powers .\\nRescheduling would mean moving cannabis to lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make medical access easier and help curb search powers used to harass and detain tamariki .\\nIt could even mean bringing back the defunct Class D for restricted substances , introduced by Helen Clark ’ s government but repealed under Key .\\nRescheduling is not legalisation or decriminalisation , so even the most miserly interpretation of the cannabis referendum result , say , that taken by Andrew Little , would not be broken by doing this most meagre of moves .\\nTogether with pardoning our cannabis convicts , and being open to local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a huge impact on New Zealand ’ s half million regular users , two million canna-curious , and the 100,000 still carrying criminal records for something many of us

action in the provocative expansion of NATO to Russian borders , there has never been justification for war with all the needless suffering and death which follows .\\nIn response to Russia ’ s initial invasion in February , the government issued an immediate condemnation and within a few days had announced a first round of sanctions against Russia .\\nThese include a 35 % tariff on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bans on exports with military potential and travel bans against Russians with close links to the Kremlin .\\nNow , in response to Russia ’ s announcement of the annexation of four Ukrainian

the full force of international condemnation and punitive sanctions .\\nRussia is not the only country wielding annexation as a weapon however .\\nIt ’ s hard to keep a straight face with the jaw-dropping statement from Israeli ’ s Foreign Ministry last week that “ Israel supports the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine .\\nWe will not recognize the annexation of the four provinces by Russia.\\n” Prominent Israeli writer Gideon Levy is scathing of his government ’ s hypocrisy over Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for decades .\\n“ Where to begin ?\\nWith an occupying state preaching to a different occupying state ?\\nWith an annexing state announcing that it won ’ t recognize a different annexation ?\\n” What Levy is referring to is Israel ’ s ongoing annexation of Palestinian land , with barely a peep from any of the countries now protesting so loudly against Russia .\\nIsrael set the scene for the annexation of Palestinian land in 1967 when it attacked neighbouring countries and took over the entire area of historic Palestine – @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sea – which it continues to occupy today .\\nRepeated United Nations resolutions have not been enough to force the withdrawal of the Israeli military and Israel has been progressively annexing this land , area by area , ever since .\\nIsrael has annexed Syria ’ s Golan Heights and East Jerusalem as well as threatening annexation of vast swathes of the Occupied West Bank – land ear-marked for a Palestinian state .\\nIsrael has already turned this area into Swiss cheese by establishing over 200 illegal , Jewish-only settlements , housing more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much so that an independent , viable Palestinian state is no longer possible .\\nIn the early 2000s Israel built what it called a “ security wall ” ( accurately dubbed an “ apartheid wall ” by Palestinians ) which cut through Palestinian areas and annexed further large areas of Palestinian land .\\nThis wall was declared illegal by the International Court of Justice but it still stands today as a symbol of enforced annexation .\\nThe latest area facing annexation is at Masafer Yatta in the Occupied West Bank where the Israeli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has turned this area of 20 Palestinian villages into a “ live fire zone ” to force the Palestinians out .\\nBit by bit , annexation is the weapon Israel is using to progressively steal Palestinian land and expel the Palestinians .\\nIsrael wants the land without the people .\\nIsrael has its phony justifications to occupy and annex just as Russia has .\\nFormer Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , who looks to be on track to regain the Prime Ministerial role in Israel ’ s November election , says a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named after Jews ( Judea ) and must be annexed by Israel .\\nThe name Judea is used in some faith histories such as the Bible , but this is no justification for annexation .\\nIf it were then perhaps the Italians should annex the US because America is named after the Italian explorer , Amerigo Vespucci .\\nOr perhaps the Netherland ’ s should annex Aotearoa New Zealand because this country was named New Zealand by the Dutch explorer Able Tasman .\\nJustification for annexation is always self-serving .\\n“ It ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscle twitches on the faces of Israel ’ s decision makers and ordinary citizens when talking about the Russia occupation…it violates international law and the resolutions of the international community… What about the Israeli occupation ?\\nIs it prettier ?\\nMore legal ?\\nIs it not violent and brutal ?\\nHas it not killed thousands of innocent people , including hundreds of children ?\\nThe Israeli occupation is simply older and more rooted ” Israel has refused to put sanctions on Russia .\\nIt doesn ’ t want to draw attention to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hypocrite for supporting BDS ( Boycott , Divestment and Sanctions ) against Russia but crying “ anti-semitism ” when calls for BDS are made against Israel for the same policies .\\nIn the meantime I ’ ve lost count of the human rights organisations , such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty international which have , quite rightly , called out Israel as an apartheid state .\\nApartheid is a “ crime against humanity ” under international law but New Zealand is all but silent .\\nIt ’ s time our own government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy ’

the elector ( or potential elector ) is no longer in residence .\\nShort of introducing a decidedly intrusive system of comprehensive citizen surveillance , however , it is difficult to see how this problem might be overcome .\\nLet us not forget that enrolling to vote ( as opposed to actually casting a vote ) is compulsory in New Zealand .\\nIt is the duty of every citizen to ensure that he or she is on the Electoral Roll .\\nFortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlike the USA ) is extraordinarily easy .\\nIt can be done in a few minutes online , or at any Post Office .\\nThe only obstacle confronting those who move houses frequently from updating their details prior to the postal ballots being sent out is their own indifference to the electoral process .\\nAs many commentators , confronted with the losers ’ accusations of a “ rigged ” 2022 local government election , have noted , there ’ s not a lot that citizens , sufficiently motivated , can not get .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ instant to secure tickets to the concerts of their favourite artists .\\nBargain hunters will queue for hours to get first crack at a big-box retailer ’ s discounted stock .\\nFar less effort is required to enrol and vote in an election .\\nAll that ’ s required is the will .\\nThe other loud complaint of the losers is that there were far too few ballot-boxes made available for those tardy electors seeking to deposit their ballot-papers .\\nGiven that upwards of 64,000 votes were successfully cast between sunrise and noon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaint lacks credibility .\\nFurther undermining the charge , is the fact that during the fortnight-long voting period for local elections , there are ballot-boxes located every few hundred metres for the convenience of electors .\\nThey ’ re called post-boxes .\\nMaking it easier to vote was , precisely , why Postal Voting was introduced in 1989 .\\nYes , yes , yes !\\nYounger voters don ’ t use post-boxes , don ’ t even know what they look like , and certainly wouldn ’ t know where to find one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voters , ready and eager to participate in the democratic process , could always overcome their ignorance by summoning-up the courage to ask one of those hideous human-beings aged over 65 where the nearest post-box is located .\\nChances are they ’ d discover there ’ s one opposite the neighbourhood dairy , or located conveniently right outside their favourite café .\\nBut , that would require them to act as if they were members of a community made up of multiple ethnicities and generations – wouldn ’ t it ?\\nUnfortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transform the volksgemeinschaft into an app instantly downloadable to the 18-25-year-old citizen ’ s smartphone .\\nThe least acceptable argument put forward by the Centre-left losers of the 2022 local government elections is that , somehow , the results represent ‘ The Revenge of the Baby Boomers ’ .\\nThe claim , here , is that , somehow , everyone over the age of 55 in Auckland , Christchurch and Dunedin , telepathically received the instruction to dash the hopes of their children and grandchildren by voting for Wayne Brown , Phil Mauger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Efeso Collins , David Meates and Aaron Hawkins .\\nSecure in their obscenely overpriced homes , these Boomers experienced no difficulties in getting their voting papers .\\nIndeed , some of them received more than one set .\\nSome were – shock !\\nhorror !\\n– multiple voters .\\nThat ’ s right .\\nIf you own a rated ( i.e .\\na taxed ) property in any region , district or city , you are indeed entitled to vote for the body that struck the rate ( i.e .\\nimposed the tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entitlement is based is as old as democracy itself .\\nIt underpins every Westminster-style parliament .\\nIt even provided the key slogan of the American Revolution of 1776 .\\n“ No taxation without representation !\\n” What is not correct , however , is that any elector in New Zealand is permitted to vote more than once in the same contest .\\nA wealthy Boomer may own six houses in Auckland , but he is not entitled to six votes .\\nHis representation on the body taxing his properties is secured by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way as the young renter ’ s representation .\\nThe Boomer ’ s holiday-home in Coromandel , being taxed , does entitle him to vote – once – in Coromandel .\\nBut only for the candidates standing in that locality .\\nThe notion that Auckland ’ s Boomer landlords were casting fistfuls of votes for Wayne Brown is risible .\\nProof only of how sorely needed civics classes are in our schools .\\nA powerful sense of entitlement does , however , lie at the heart of the 2022 losers ’ sour grapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle , but the sense of entitlement ingrained in political activists who believe themselves to be on the right ( that is to say left ) side of history .\\nThis certainty concerning their own ideological rectitude exists in inverse proportion to their knowledge of the actual nuts-and-bolts of historical and political agency .\\nWayne , Phil and Jules didn ’ t win because they are jointly in control of some sort of bizarre Boomer hive-mind ; they won because they had a more accurate fix than Efeso , David and Aaron on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Dunedin , who were most likely to vote , wanted ( and did not want ) from their respective mayors and councils .\\nThe brutal fact of the matter is that the centre-left mayoral candidates in Auckland , Christchurch and Dunedin ran campaigns plagued by a conspicuous lack of one , or more , of the “ Three Ms ” – Money , Message , Machine .\\n( Hat-tip to Mike Hutcheson . )\\nThe proof of this contention is that Tory Whanau , the “ Green ” candidate for the Wellington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lay her hands on all three of the “ Ms ” – and she won the election hands-down .\\nTory found out what the over-55s wanted ; but she also found out what the 18-25s , and all the other demographics , wanted ; and then she offered it to them in a well-organised , positive , and successful campaign .\\nDemocracy isn ’ t cheap , and it isn ’ t easy – but it simple .\\nDon ’ t insist that the voters be given what they don ’ t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people walk .\\nNever , ever , be a sore loser .\\nAnd , always remember : vox Populi , vox Dei .\\nThe voice of the people , is the voice of God .',\n",

@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dangerous enthusiasms ; turned out to be anything but a blank slate upon which the Bolsheviks could freely write the future .\\nTheir country may no longer have been called Russia , but Russians they remained .\\nTheir empire also , which , thanks to their heroic efforts against the exterminationist Germans , expanded to encompass all of Eastern Europe .\\nNo Tsar had ever wielded the power of Joseph Stalin .\\nThe Soviet Union glowered over Western Europe and the world through black , bear-like eyes : the object , alike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and abiding fear .\\nLacking in this Red empire was the first Vladimir ’ s readiness to wager everything to move the experiment forward .\\nStalin was ruthless , but he wasn ’ t brave .\\nThe man lived his whole life in fear , and made damn sure the Soviet people did the same .\\nLenin ’ s Petri dish was poisoned by his fear .\\nThe Soviet Empire that evolved may have been bigger and more terrifying that the Tsars ’ , but Homo Sovieticus was a pretty wretched specimen .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federation he rules , is a hot mess of geopolitical and cultural insecurities .\\nHe despises the late Mikhail Gorbachev for presiding over the dissolution of the Soviet Union .\\nThat event , according to Putin : “ was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century .\\nAs for the Russian people , it became a genuine tragedy .\\nTens of millions of our fellow citizens and countrymen found themselves beyond the fringes of Russian territory.\\n” What Putin missed completely was the historical courage of Gorbachev ’ s all-or-nothing bet that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet prove equal to its creator ’ s optimistic vision .\\nThat Gorbachev lost the bet is , of course , the best possible proof that Homo Sovieticus was an evolutionary dead-end .\\nThat the Soviet Union ’ s successor states all became hopelessly corrupt kleptocracies merely demonstrated how degraded Soviet Man ’ s political and economic DNA truly was .\\nThat Putin rose to become Russia ’ s new strongman heaped irony on tragedy .\\nBecause it ’ s all there in the second Vladimir : the nihilism , the cynicism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that re-swallowing the Ukrainian people .\\nFirst devoured by Lenin in the 1920s , and then eaten again by Stalin in the 1930s .\\nThe Leninist will-to-power is also there in Putin , but the dream is different .\\nNot a speculative blueprint for humanity ’ s future , but a necromancer ’ s resurrection of Russia ’ s obscurantist past .\\nNot the white-hot ripples of modernist self-confidence , but the poisonous fogs and vapours of the Middle Ages .',\n",

       "  'content': 'Jacinda quite rightly criticised Winston Peters on the weekend for ‘ politicking ’ and making ‘ grandiose statements ’ to get headlines , but she won ’ t ‘ entertain ’ the comments , i.e.\\n, she won ’ t engage with the substance of his comments .\\nAs if to talk will legitimise it .\\nThis is a weak ‘ moral high ground ’ strategy that has a long history of failing .\\nYes , perhaps you don ’ t want to offend a future coalition partner ( it didn ’ t worry Peters ) and yes , history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baiting largely without policy substance .\\nBut he accuses the government of pursing a ‘ separatist agenda ’ and driving ‘ inverse racism ’ .\\nThis drives against the substance of our civil society and our supposedly ( should be ) founding document , The Treaty of Waitangi .\\nHis comments might all seem like childish nonsense to a well informed person but many people aren ’ t .\\nHe has almost always pulled in over 5 % of voters with these appeals .\\nAnd it will be real to some people because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights that are contained within the Treaty for Maori .\\nA people whose lands and income assets have largely been stolen or prised from them .\\nMr Peters can ’ t be just left in a vacuum as his ideas and fantasies will expand to fill it .\\nIt needs to have a strategy to debunk and create a counter narrative .\\nAnd this is where the moral high ground approach is not based on understanding people and their experience ; it is not engagement with others reality .\\nThe moral high ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we are above this , approach to politics and society .\\nThe centrist fear is that the election will spin into talking about race and racism , which no civilised person should discuss , rather than discuss the ‘ real issues ’ .\\nBut Mr Peters has already done it , the genie is out !\\nAre centrists afraid of defending anti racism ?\\nDefending Treaty obligations ?\\nIt is this self centred arrogance of holding the moral high ground that helped bring down Helen Clarks government to the ignorant imp Key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because that was to lower herself to the slurs .\\nAnd she felt powerless to take on some myths over the foreshore and seabed ( absolute stupidity and centrist fear driven action on her part ) .\\nThe same type of process even helped Mr Key resign , his chosen powerlessness to act on rising housing prices made him look an out of touch fool with his continual , ‘ there is no housing crisis ’ comments .\\nAnd this is the arrogance or complacency of government that commentators forever ramble about without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ s about a Government finding it hard to know how to deal with an issue so ignoring or downplaying it , ( the centrists playbook ) and getting caught looking out of touch and therefore arrogant .\\nLabour is currently walking right into the same obvious trap over race believing it to be the moral high ground .\\nThe issues Mr Peters raise are real for some .\\nDeal with it forcefully and directly by vision ( positive message ) and attack/refutation ( negative message ) .\\nNegative messaging is critically important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people like Mr Peters at face value because they lack the background knowledge or experience to question it .\\nNegative messaging helps people think , it does the hard work for people so they see the other side .\\nAnd the engagement of the ideas looks like honesty , strength and respect .\\nBut the snobby centrist elites think racism is a fixed point of moral high ground that they own .\\nBut Mr Peters is playing that fixed point against them .\\nHe is positioning as the anti racist .\\nAre the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position or they surrender it even if only for a few .\\nMr Peters has a real argument because it connects to some peoples idea of what equality means on race , i.e .\\nrather than seeing it as treaty rights .\\nJacinda needs to be forceful , not aloof and disengaged .\\np.s .\\nThe centrists need to reject the childish Michelle Obama rubbish “ when they go low we go high ” .\\nThat approach didn ’ t turn out so well did it .\\nSupporters wanted the US to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people again .\\nHilary didn ’ t fight for this narrative .\\nHilary thought she was claiming the moral high ground by not fighting stupidity .\\nBut in doing so she actually showed the inherent ivory tower bigotry in her own position ;

there was no problem in the court case except the one in her head .\\nBut the current Labour/Greens are on the same losing slope .\\nThe local body elections largely confirm this , and one of the central issues is the stupid Labour/Green strategy on affordable housing ( i.e .\\nallowing bully building by private developers so they can maximise profit ) that will simply not deliver affordable housing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a declining housing market but still completely unaffordable .\\nBut the centrists chant , we can ’ t back down or rethink or we look weak .\\nNo , it is better to look weak rather than stupid .\\nStay true to three waters but back down over housing in historic suburbs .\\nBrown fields are central , build affordable housing over them .\\nYour current strategy to build in suburbs is stupid .\\nEven the Lake Hayes build is miles out with massive new infrastructure needed .\\nBuild on central brown fields @ @ @ @ @ @',\n",

       "  'content': 'WILLIE JACKSON is caught in a trap of his own making .\\nThree groups , tasked in April with developing a detailed plan for implementing the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples ( UNDRIP ) have steadfastly refused to play the bureaucratic game the Minister for Māori Development has forced upon them .\\nIn essence , they have delivered Jackson an offer neither he , nor the Cabinet , can accept .\\nTheir “ Declaration Plan ” , clearly politically unacceptable , has been kept under wraps for months .\\nNon-plussed , Jackson asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representatives of Te Puni Kokiri , Pou Tikanga ( Iwi Leaders Group ) and the Human Rights Commission ; to present a revised document for Cabinet ’ s consideration by July .\\nWith November fast approaching , the document ’ s authors have yet to respond .\\nIt is difficult to interpret this tardiness as anything other than a deliberate effort to run down the clock on Jackson .\\nThe Declaration Plan ’ s authors appear confident that their failure to adhere to the Minister ’ s consultative timetable will make it virtually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior to the 2023 General Election .\\nClearly , a high-stakes hand of political poker is being played out here .\\nIt is hard to interpret the Declaration plan ’ s authors ’ failure to meet Jackson ’ s deadline as anything other than an act of deliberate defiance .\\nWhat has prompted their non-compliance ?\\nThe most obvious answer is to be found in the unusual ordering of the “ Declaration Plan ’ s ” preparation .\\nRather than gather a broadly representative group of cultural , political and legal experts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implementation – something in the nature of a Royal Commission of Inquiry – Jackson initiated a round of consultations with Māori groups across the country , and then tasked TPK , the Iwi Leaders Group and the HRC with producing a “ first draft ” of the results .\\nOnce endorsed by Cabinet , this draft Declaration Plan was to be presented to the whole population of New Zealand for consideration , comment , and revision .\\nAny Māori ethno-nationalist worthy of the name will immediately recognise Jackson ’ s action-plan as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water-down their proposals to the point where a Pakeha-dominated Cabinet would find them acceptable .\\nThis signed-off Declaration Plan must then be subjected to all the slings and arrows of Pakeha racism – the mouthpieces of which will undoubtedly demand even more watering-down .\\nBy the time the process is complete , New Zealand ’ s plan for implementing UNDRIP will be so anodyne that even Jair Bolsonaro could give it the thumbs-up !\\nIt is worth recalling at this point that a comprehensive “ Declaration Plan ” already exists .\\nCommissioned by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nanaia Mahuta , in 2019 , the He Puapua report , sets forth a step-by-step process for bringing Aotearoa into full compliance with UNDRIP by 2040 – the 200th anniversary of the signing of te Tiriti o Waitangi .\\nKept under wraps by Jacinda Ardern ’ s government , He Puapua was clearly regarded as far too radical to be placed before the New Zealand electorate in 2020 .\\nWhen , inevitably , the document found its way into the public domain , the newly-elected Labour Government was quick to deny that its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ – in any way driving Government policy .\\nThe Prime Minister curtly ruled-out He Puapua ’ s plan for a Māori upper-house of Parliament .\\nThe institutions brought together by Jackson can hardly have missed the unspoken terms-of-reference underpinning their endeavour .\\nUnder no circumstances were they to present a Declaration Plan as radical as He Puapua .\\nNot only that , but Matike Mai Aotearoa : Independent Working Group on Constitutional Transformation , an impressive consultative exercise in its own right , commissioned by the Iwi Leaders Group , and conducted under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which , itself , provided powerful inspiration for the authors of the He Puapua report , was also to be consigned to the “ too-radical ” basket .\\nSo constrained , the authorial group might as well have subtitled their Declaration Plan “ Uncle Tom ’ s Report ” .\\nNevertheless , the institutions tasked with drawing up the Declaration Plan had no option but to serve .\\nThat being the case they seem to have agreed that the whole exercise should either produce a document worthy of UNDRIP , or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to nothing .\\nThis is what they appear to have done .\\nJackson was presented with a Declaration Plan which , almost certainly , incorporated the core ideas of both Matike Mai and He Puapua .\\nGiven the extent of consultation within Maoridom which preceded and informed the Matike Mai working-group ’ s report ; and in light of the courageous creativity of He Puapua , the draft Declaration Plan ’ s authors could hardly have done otherwise .\\nBy any reasonable measure , Matike Mai and He Puapua are the truest reflection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackson ’ s group didn ’ t back-up the work already done , then they risked being written-off as latter-day kupapa .\\nJackson , meanwhile , is left holding a draft Declaration Plan he can ’ t present to Cabinet , and which its authors refuse to re-write .\\nAnd , the clock is ticking .\\nWhen he meets with the authors on Friday , what are Jackson ’ s options ?\\nHe could threaten to release their draft plan to the public , reasoning that the reaction of most Pakeha would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fulfilling New Zealand ’ s obligations under UNDRIP would come to a shuddering halt .\\nIf he was feeling particularly embittered and Machiavellian , he could further argue that the racist backlash would be so powerful that the Government would have to abandon , at least temporarily , its whole co-governance agenda – Three Waters in particular .\\nCould they not produce a document that would reassure Pakeha that UNDRIP was no threat : a document that would actually make the introduction of co-governance easier ?\\nIsn ’ t Māori control of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shrewd arguments , certainly , but they don ’ t get Jackson out of his trap .\\nHe simply can ’ t escape the fact that to meet the requirements of UNDRIP – let alone te Tiriti – the Crown will have to cede an unacceptably large amount of its sovereign power to Māori .\\nAs a Minister of that Crown , it is more than Jackson ’ s warrant is worth to place such a proposition upon the Cabinet Table .\\nIn the Realm of New Zealand there can be only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved as inescapable to Moana Jackson , and to the authors of He Puapua , as it so clearly has been to the authors of the draft Declaration Plan .\\nNeither UNDRIP nor te Tiriti o Waitangi will ever be fully realised in the Realm of New Zealand .\\nTo fulfil the promises of these documents a wholly new kind of state will be required – one so radically different to the state New Zealanders presently inhabit , that their acceptance of it could only be secured in the conditions of a full-scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can sell a full-scale revolution to this Labour Government .',\n",

       "  'content': 'The Treaty of Waitangi was signed between the Crown and the Maori land owners of New Zealand .\\nArticle 2 guaranteed Maori full exclusive and undisturbed possession of their lands , estates , forests , fisheries and other properties .\\nMaori were the private property owners of it all ; except the bits they chose to sell .\\nArticle 3 rmade Maori British subjects with all the same rights and privileges , and those rights must include protection of private property .\\nArticle two made this private property guarantee stronger by recognising that private property can be collectively or individually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognised as Maori private property .\\nThe Crown for many years did not honour the treaty and the Maori private property rights guaranteed within the Treaty .\\nThis left Maori without significant income assets and left to live in poverty .\\nThis is the situation for many today and it faces all of us .\\nBut some people think that Article 1 of the Treaty meant Maori gave away full sovereignty thus allowing the government to do what it liked with Maori private property , and what happened in the past is legitimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 does not create an authoritarian state where Maori private property rights exist at the whim of the Crown .\\n( Though Maori may in practise have experienced it like this ) .\\nBritain was a constitutional monarchy which is a democracy where private property rights are respected So when Mr Peters speaks of honouring the Treaty as creating ‘ inverse racism ’ with Maori now ascendant over pakeha he is actually saying property rights can be stolen and not respected with proper compensation .\\nFor example the compensation to Tainui for land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the value of what was stolen .\\nImagine if farmers had land taken for roading and they only got 3 % of the land value back .\\nWouldn ’ t that be outrageous and unjust ?\\nBut Mr Peters is in effect saying this is okay .\\nSo should we do this for roading changes ?\\nMr Peters rails that Maori are getting more rights than Pakeha .\\nThis is simply not true .\\nFor example three waters .\\nThe Treaty of Waitangi recognises and guarantees Maori as having private property rights over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government engages with Maori about their private property .\\nMaori rights to equal treatment for their private property rights have simply been trashed by our previous governments and their courts .\\nAnd the basis of this was mass immigration , without a written constitution and courts with the rights to protect them , that marginalised the Maori community .\\nAlso I ’ m ignoring here the obvious significant differences between the Maori and Pakeha versions of Article 1 which clearly show Maori were not surrendering sovereign tribal authority and that co-governance rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s just this reading is not essential to show rights are not currently equally held .\\nThose who complain about Maori privilege are actually making their own rights more vulnerable .\\nWouldn ’ t the complainers efforts be better directed to the business community working hand over fist to increase immigration so they can pay lower wages and not have to pay higher tax to train and educate our own citizens ?\\nWhen immigration is completely open for business our New Zealand tall poppies will always be overshadowed a few taller ones from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nOften people come here as a stepping stone to the lucky country with which we have open borders , and it is wealthier .\\nAnd its mass immigration that is one of the factors putting pressure on our essential infrastructure like housing and health .\\nWhy isn ’ t Mr Peters pushing for higher taxes on businesses who are requesting and pushing for greater immigration so these businesses pay for the essential infrastructure ?\\nWhy is Mr Peters beating up on Maori who just want their property rights respected equally to others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treaty , all New Zealanders , whether we like it or not .\\nIt is our word and for our personal integrity we must honour and respect our word .\\nSome say it isn ’ t and assert they didn ’ t sign it .\\nWell driving on the left hand side of the road is not something they signed either .\\nBig trouble if you don ’ t respect that .\\nAnd yes those who disagree can pursue a change and want to put us all through the huge cost of completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dangers of some forgetting and driving on the wrong side .\\nBest of luck on that .\\nBut for the Treaty they will have to have a pretty good offer because Maori as the other party to the Treaty have lost so much that they will be relunctant to give it up .\\nCurrent Maori just like the original signatories of the Treaty will be highly unlikely to simply surrender full sovereigtny to the Crown , for nothing .\\nThose who want to simply rip it up and not negotiate don ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you must respect others .\\nThey can go to Putin ’ s Russia and get conscripted .\\nSee how nice it is when somebody bullies and pushes you around .\\nWith Winston ’ s whining and New Zealand society changing quite dramatically through immigration , does this raise the risk of a second wave of less rights for Maori ?\\nWho else ?\\nLGBTQ people ?\\n( Pushing down on minorities is a world trend at the moment ) .\\nNow is the time to learn from the past and recognise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New Zealand .\\nWe must urgently develop a proper constitution with a court system that can defend civil rights from the risks of tyranny by a majority who if mislead by demagogy and misinformation may make laws that violate civil and Treaty rights of New Zealanders .\\nNew Zealand has not been an equal and just society let ’ s make it one with a strong written constitution .',\n",

       "  'content': 'A woke government , served by a woke broadcaster , might just be persuaded to embark on a bold new broadcasting journey .\\nNOBODY HAS YET come up with a credible case for amalgamating Radio New Zealand and Television New Zealand .\\nEven so , the merger proceeds apace , costing the taxpayer a ridiculous amount of money – to no good end .\\nNo one truly believes the quality of the broadcasting product will improve .\\nThe present audiences of both networks have longstanding gripes with the overall direction of their public broadcasters , but the response of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very policies their audiences find most objectionable .\\nWith no clear rationale for the amalgamation of RNZ and TVNZ on offer , the cynicism of those who were formerly public broadcasting ’ s strongest defenders can only grow .\\nThe pall of pessimism which has settled over those who still believe in the possibilities of public broadcasting has not been lifted by vague references to the need for a reliable source of public information .\\nCiting the growing strength of the purveyors of misinformation and disinformation on social media , government mouthpieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as place where New Zealanders anxious to learn what ’ s really going on can go to for “ the facts ” .\\nThey are being encouraged to think of the new entity as a sort of beefed-up version of the Prime Minister ’ s infamous “ podium of truth ” during Covid .\\nThe newsrooms and current affairs production hubs of RNZ and TVNZ have become ideological monocultures .\\nSenior executives , producers , journalists , technical staff and , seemingly , the entire workforce of the public broadcasters , subscribe to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , social and cultural reality .\\nA journalist wishing to put together a programme on the bitter divisions rending the women ’ s movement over transgender issues , for example , would not only be denied permission , she would be lucky to hold on to her job .\\nThe RNZ and TVNZ of today grow only a single crop .\\nIf you don ’ t like the taste of “ Woke ” – then you had better find an alternative menu of ideas .\\nPerhaps it is this complete indifference to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that enlivened the public broadcasters of yesteryear that explains the new entity .\\nAt the summit of both RNZ and TVNZ sit people who despise the whole Reithian concept of broadcasting as a public service .\\nIt was the first Director General of the BBC , John Reith , who formulated the original three word mission-statement of Britain ’ s public broadcaster .\\nThe purpose of the BBC , said Reith was to “ inform , educate , and entertain ” .\\nFor many years Reith ’ s formula underpinned the operations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nIt could not , however , survive the onset of the neoliberal project in the mid-1980s .\\nThe latter reduced TVNZ to a commercial operation indistinguishable from those operating in the private sector .\\nIt ’ s job was to sell eyeballs to advertisers and to hell with “ inform , educate , entertain ” .\\nRNZ would likely have suffered a similar fate , had it not been so vociferously defended by its loyal listeners .\\nThwarted in their mission to simply wipe out RNZ , the neoliberals opted to starve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it adequately .\\nCommitted to public service broadcasting , RNZ management and staff contrived to do more with less year after year .\\nUltimately , however , it was the government of the day that appointed the Board of RNZ , and the Board that appointed its CEO .\\nInevitably , the day came when the Reithian rear-guard was overwhelmed .\\nAt the summit of RNZ , an idea took root that it was morally indefensible for public broadcasters to assume they knew better what the people of New Zealand needed than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RNZ was an educated , middle-class , Pakeha Baby-Boomer redoubt : an island of intellectual snobbery and unconscious bias in a sea of younger , browner , New Zealanders with very different values and tastes .\\nIn the estimation of both the RNZ Board , and its CEO , the time had come for a mighty shake-up .\\nTheir first move was an attempt to downgrade and marginalise the Concert Programme and replace it with a youth-oriented network modelled on a hip , Black , New York radio-station .\\nBut , in what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign to save Reithian radio , the supporters of the Concert Programme – led by former Prime Minister , Helen Clark , forced the RNZ Board and the CEO to put their plans on hold .\\nNot to worry , there is always more than one way to skin a cat .\\nWith the election of a majority Labour Government in late 2020 , a pathway opened for those who wanted to radically remake RNZ .\\nA woke government , served by a woke broadcaster , might just be persuaded to embark on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merging it with the brain-dead TVNZ , the cerebrally-vital RNZ would finally be in a position to ditch its elitist Boomer audience and show Aotearoa what Generations X , Y , and Z could do .\\nIf this what happened , then , obviously , the new state broadcasting entity will be run by the bright boys and girls at the top of RNZ .\\nTVNZ really will become “ radio with pictures ” .\\nJust how much informing , educating and entertaining will go on in the new , clumsily named , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody ’ s guess .\\nBy those Boomers who fought so hard for RNZ and its Reithian virtues , “ F-Boy Island ” is unlikely to be received as an adequate substitute for Kim Hill and Jim Mora .',\n",

       "  'content': 'A Fiji-based academic has challenged the Pacific region ’ s media and policymakers over climate crisis coverage , asking whether the discriminatory style of reporting was a case of climate injustice .\\nAssociate Professor Shailendra Singh , head of the journalism programme at the University of the South Pacific , said climate press conferences and meetings were too focused on providing coverage of “ privileged elite viewpoints ” .\\n“ Elites have their say , but communities facing the brunt of climate change have their voices muted , ” he told the Look at the Evidence : Climate Journalism and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role of journalism in raising climate awareness in the week-long Open Access Australasia virtual conference .\\nDr Singh , who is also on the editorial board of Pacific Journalism Review and was speaking for the recently formed Asia Pacific Media Network ( APMN ) , threw open several questions to the participants about what appeared to be “ discriminatory reporting ” .\\n“ Is slanted media coverage marginalising grassroots voices ?\\nIs this a form of climate injustice ?\\n” he asked .\\nHe cited many of the hurdles impacting on the ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate crisis effectively , such as lack of resources in small media organisations and lack of reporting expertise .\\n‘ Jack-of-all-trades ’ “ We are unable to have specialist climate reporters as in some other countries ; our journalists tend to be a jack-of-all-trades , and master of none , ” he said .\\nHe did not mean this in a “ disparaging manner ” , saying “ it ’ s just our reality ” given limited resources .\\n• The smallness of Pacific media systems ; • Limited revenue and small profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among journalists ( mostly due to uncompetitive salaries ) ; • Pacific journalists “ don ’ t have the luxury ” of specialising in one area ; and • No media economies of scale .\\n“ Our journalists don ’ t build sufficient knowledge in any one topic for consistent or in-depth reporting , ” he said .\\n“ And this is more deeply felt in areas such as climate reporting.\\n” He cited pioneering research on Pacific climate reporting by Samoan climate change journalist Lagipoiva Dr Cherelle Jackson , saying such Pacific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ‘ Staying afloat in Paradise ’ A research fellow with the Reuters Institute and Oxford University , Dr Jackson carried out research on how media in her homeland and six other Pacific countries were covering climate change .\\nThe 2010 report was titled Staying Afloat in Paradise : Reporting Climate Change in the Pacific .\\nPacific journalists and editors “ have a responsibility to inform readers on how climatic changes can affect them , she argued .\\nBut this did not translate into the pages of their newspapers .\\n“ Climate change is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacific newsrooms as issues such as health , education and politics which all take precedence over even general environment reporting , ” Dr Jackson wrote .\\n“ For a region mainly classified by the United Nations as ‘ least developed ’ and ‘ developing ’ countries , it is apparent that there are more pressing issues than climate change .\\n“ But the fact that the islands of the Pacific are already at the bottom end of the scale in regards to wealth and infrastructure , and the fact that climate change is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ islands , should make it a big story .\\nBut it isn ’ t. ” She has continued her advocacy work on climate change as climate editor of the Associated Press and completing a doctorate on the topic .\\nThe Open Access Australasia media panel today also included Newsroom ’ s Marc Daalder , The Conversation ’ s New Zealand science editor Veronica Meduna , and Guardian columnist Dr Jeff Sparrow of the University of Melbourne.Critical of paywalls Daalder spoke about how open access to scientific papers was vitally important for journalists who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just abstracts .\\nHe was critical of the paywalls on many scientific research papers .\\nOpen access enabled journalists to do their job better and this was clearly shown during the covid-19 pandemic — “ and we need this to happen for climate reporting ” .\\nMeduna said it took far too long for research , such as on climate change , to filter through into public debate .\\nOpen access helped to reduce that gap .\\nShe also said the success of The Conversation model showed that there was a growing demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the help of journalists .\\nDr Sparrow called for a social movement for meaningful action on the climate crisis and more scientific literacy was needed to enable this .\\nHighly critical of the “ dysfunctional ” academic publishing industry , he said open access would contribute to “ radically accessible ” science for the public .\\nThe panel was organised by Tuwhera digital and open access publishing team at Auckland University of Technology .\\n• Other webinars in the Open Access Week that ends on Friday .',\n",

       "  'content': 'UNWILLING TO ENDURE the opprobrium associated with its “ gulags ” , the Soviet Union of the 1970s changed tack .\\nRather than sending dissidents to labour camps ( gulags ) the Soviet authorities decided to redefine dissidence as a form of mental illness .\\nOpposition to the Soviet system could now be presented as a sickness , not deserving of condemnation , but care .\\nOpponents of the USSR no longer faced summary trial and incarceration .\\nInstead they were to be diagnosed and hospitalised .\\nThe barbed wire fences of the labour camps rusted away , replaced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nResisting the tyranny of the Communist Party didn ’ t mean you were bad – it meant you were mad .\\nThat this grim historical detail should be recalled more than thirty years after the collapse of the Soviet Union is due to Ao Mai te Rā | The Anti-Racism Kaupapa a document which first saw the light of day back in August 2022 under the rubric of the Ministry of Health .\\nSubtitled “ Combatting racism in the health and disability system ” , Ao Mai te Rāboldly declares : “ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to achieving health equity and the vision of pae ora – healthy futures for all New Zealanders.\\n” Intentionally , or unintentionally , this statement of official health policy raises the spectre of political dissidence being redefined as a form of individual and/or social pathology .\\nLike Covid-19 , racism is being presented as a threat to the future health and wellbeing of New Zealanders .\\nThis threat must be eliminated – presumably by a process akin to inoculation .\\nBut racism is not a sickness , it is a political belief .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ argued against and condemned .\\nBut , attempting to eliminate “ all forms of racism ” under the guise of a government health programme is sinister in the extreme .\\nTo oppose the purposeful imposition of ethnically derived distinctions is one thing ; to treat the creators of such distinctions as “ sick ” is something else entirely .\\nPathologising racism instantly casts any kind of political debate about ethnicity and nationalism as illegitimate .\\nThe Ministry of Health ’ s paper presents racists as the carriers of a dangerous racism virus .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ past two years , those deemed to be carrying a dangerous virus by the Ministry can be detained and confined until they no longer test “ positive ” .\\nShould racists refuse to “ unite against the racism virus ” by undergoing a government-mandated programme of “ inoculation ” , they could end up losing both their employment , and their ability to access all but the most basic services .\\nThe experience of the public fight against Covid-19 has revealed just how injurious to social cohesion and the public peace such draconian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , let ’ s not forget , Covid-19 was an virus !\\nArming the state with equivalent powers against a virus would unquestionably engender much greater resistance .\\nThat the Ministry of Health anticipates such resistance is made clear in another document released under its name .\\nEntitled Position statement and working definitions for racism and anti-racism in the health system in Aotearoa New Zealand , this document defines racism in ways that leave no ethnic groups – apart from Māori and Pasifika – in a position to assert their innocence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , find themselves declared guilty from multiple perspectives : historically , politically , scientifically , culturally , institutionally and socially .\\nIt is a verdict in which the legal concept of mens rea ( evil intent ) plays no part .\\nThis is because racism can be both conscious and unconscious .\\nRegardless of whether a Pakeha New Zealander ’ s closet contains a Ku Klux Klansman ’ s robes , or an anti-apartheid banner from 1981 , they are racists – beyond all reasonable doubt .\\nGiven that the Position Statement was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ministry of Health , but also the Government of New Zealand , what should we make of the state ’ s “ working definition ” of racism ?\\nRacism comprises racial prejudice and societal power and manifests in different ways .\\nIt results in the unequal distribution of power , privilege , resources and opportunity to produce outcomes that chronically favour , privilege and benefit one group over another .\\nAll forms of racism are harmful , and its effects are distinct and not felt equally .\\nThe most important conclusion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no culture , no society , no state on the surface of the planet that would not stand condemned by its content .\\nAll societies contain racial animosities and hierarchies based on religious , political , sexual and economic power .\\nEverywhere “ privilege , resources and opportunity ” are distributed arbitrarily and inequitably so as to “ favour , privilege and benefit one group over another ” .\\nEquality is a moral aspiration , not an settled condition .\\nIndeed , if one substitutes “ capitalism ” for “ racism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as well .\\nWhat , then , is the “ working definition ’ s ” purpose ?\\nThe answer , sadly , is to render any attempt by Pakeha New Zealanders to challenge the Māori- and Pasifika-centric project currently unfolding in the health sector , politically and ethically untenable .\\nWhat the “ working definition ” , and the twelve bullet points listed below it , set out to achieve is a situation in which the only acceptable role for Pakeha politicians , bureaucrats and medical professionals , is to sit quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fullest possible restitution to the victims of their racism .\\nAnd it ’ s working .\\nSo averse is the professional-managerial class of most Western states to the charge of racism that its members will accept just about anything to avoid the accusation .\\nCritical to this posture of surrender is the essential concession that it is impossible for the victims of Western racism to themselves behave in racist ways .\\nOf equal importance , is the companion concession that any suggestion that racism can be overcome by treating all human-beings as equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\n“ Race and racialisation are social and political constructs designed to categorise physical differences between people ( that is , skin colour , hair texture , geographical origins , etc ) and assign value and meaning to a hierarchically arranged racial grouping .\\nThese constructs originated from Europe and influenced the structure of society , racial superiority and hierarchy.\\n” And if you balk at the almost unbelievable historical cheek of this statement .\\nIf you want to shout out “ Have none of you studied anthropology !\\n” Or point out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world ’ s slaves were .\\nOr that there are a number of other “ constructs ” that “ originated in Europe ” – like democracy , and the quaint belief that all human-beings ( in the words of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights ) “ are born free and equal in dignity and rights .\\nThey are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.\\n” Well , then , you can only be a carrier of the racism virus , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nThe bleak Russian humourists of the 1970s expressed the difficulties of principled disagreement slightly differently : “ Only a madman ” , they declared , “ would question the superiority of the Soviet system .\\n”',\n",

       "  'content': 'Many seem to forget that the fundamental purpose of an economy is to supply goods and services to meet peoples needs and some wants .\\nCurrently people aren ’ t getting their needs met because of inequality , and that is proof the economy is failing at its fundamental purpose .\\nBut if this economy is the best or natural order , then why isn ’ t the economy naturally fixing itself ?\\nNatural at the moment is still neo liberalism .\\nThe big push in the 1980s ( Reagan/Thatcher/Friedman ) to deal with inflation and needs was to appeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This meant reducing regulations and taxes on businesses , the creators and suppliers of goods and services , allowing them to grow and thus grow the economy , and so people would be supplied with what they need .\\nOver 40 years later the sceptics have been proved 100 % right .\\nYou can ’ t grow an economy if your people can ’ t pay for goods and services ( they forgot the demand side , Keynesian economics ) .\\nAnd what businesses want to supply and at what price ; simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ align with what people need .\\n( e.g .\\nTourist rocket trips to space , rather than health care !\\nMillionaires want to follow their dreams , rather than the dreams and needs of ordinary people .\\nThat can change by putting money in the hands of ordinary people so they can buy for their dreams and needs to be met ) .\\nBut why didn ’ t supply side economic theory work and things just grow ?\\nThe fundamental flaw of our neo liberal economy was it enhanced ( or more accurate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the separation of wealth creation from the supply of goods and services to ordinary people .\\nNeo liberalism meant economic activity or wealth creation was more profitable and more easily attained by the accumulation of capital assets : shares , bonds , land , property , art , even luxury goods .\\nSo wealth creation was separated from our economy ’ s fundamental purpose , the supply of goods and services to ordinary people .\\nBut again , why did this happen ?\\nBusiness were following their necessary and logical drive to maximise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules and tax system that support and guide our economy is still based on an extractive and exploitive colonial economy model .\\n( Many people would just say it is a growth model ) .\\nThis is a world wide problem .\\nThe key mechanism through which this happens , i.e .\\nthe focus on asset accumulation as the easiest path to wealth , is that a capital asset can be purchased through a loan .\\nInterest on the loan is deductible for tax .\\nSo even if a millionaire/business can pay for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reduce tax and purchase an asset with a loan .\\nLoans also help in hiding the character of revenue as capital ( which is not taxable ) which helps in paying less tax .\\nAnd an asset fixation leads to constant ‘ sales ’ of assets sometimes between related entities , and revaluations of assets , both to increase depreciation tax claims ; and higher revaluations also allow bigger loans and more interest deductions from tax .\\nBecause of these tax mechanisms the economy shifts into debt financing everything , i.e .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy everything .\\nRent cars , rent buildings etc .\\nThere are other techniques for debt .\\nSo the finance whizz kids take over the economy , this is the financialisation of 1st world economies , with industry and manufacturing production sectors moving to exploit low wages and low regulations in third world countries .\\nBut once you take out loans to finance everything , the loan has to be secured by the value of an asset , on which the size of the loan is calculated .\\nYou can buy shares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out loans against the value of shares in your company .\\nTake out loans against the value of your assets .\\nAll helping reduce your tax bill .\\nThis is why businesses obsess over sharemarket values and why in 2008 when Obama bailed out the banks who bailed out the businesses .\\nThey pumped that money back into the share market , ( the holding of capital assets ) and not into the supply of goods and services to satisfy people ’ s needs and some wants .\\nTrump did the same again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop the loans become harder to sustain and the network of loans may have to be recalled .\\nThis would happen because there is a boundary to risk .\\nSo the economy is twisted away from the supply of goods and services to ordinary people as the way to make money and is focused on the holding of capital assets as the easiest and most profitable path to wealth .\\nThis process/mechanism is sustained by three main flaws in our colonial economy tax system .\\n• Expense deduction .\\nBusiness pays tax on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest on loans .\\n• Capital Revenue distinction for a non-individual .\\nCapital = not taxable /revenue = taxable .\\nThis distinction encourages large business to shift revenue through entities to turn revenue into something that can be called capital so it is not taxable .\\n• Transparency of ownership .\\nThe ability to create and run income related activities through offshore jurisdictions using opaque ownership structures so income can be hidden behind structures and avoid tax residency rules .\\nThese three are relatively easy to fix .\\n* And when we fix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nAnd it will return a comparative advantage to small low cost businesses and local production .\\nAll these are features of an economic model that is structurally better adapted to deal with climate change .\\nBut the wealthy people , who currently benefit will fight tooth and nail to keep the flaws .\\nEmploying a small number of lawyers and accountants for millions and billions of dollars of gain .\\nAnd they will threaten/deliver armageddon on any politician who proposes change .\\nSo the experience of neo liberal Liz Truss with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may work .\\nIn theory business should support a neo liberal politician offering rich tax cuts for a supposedly growth focused agenda .\\nBut the fundamentals of risk where too high .\\nHuge unfunded tax cuts hint that future debts will be a big drag on the UK economy and therefore growth will slow pulling down asset prices .\\nThis puts their loans and debt financing house of cards at risk .\\nThe same will happen if the UK takes on austerity too severely .\\ni.e .\\neconomic growth will stall and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because of these risks corporate investors stopped buying and without their demand asset prices will drop .\\nThe Bank of England bailed it out by buying so wealthy investor asset prices stayed high .\\nBut collapsing pensions would have also been catastrophic for ordinary people .\\nThis example shows the excessive importance of asset prices to the current economic model .\\nAnd because of potential aggressive business reactions like this Labour finance ministers and liberal centrists all over the world fear the business community ; and these leaders become hostage to their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does need a plan .\\nThe main attack by the self interested will be that removing these three flaws undermines the growth economy .\\nThey will say no tax subsidy through expenses deductions means no incentive to invest in their business , innovation will stall , growth will stall .\\nEconomic collapse will follow .\\nThis is a lie because people still want to make money and the changes simply mean moving the path to wealth back to the primary purpose of an economy ; to supply goods and services to ordinary people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nNot a path to wealth through just holding assets .\\nAnd there will still be a share market , there will be bonds and other assets and these mechanisms can still make money .\\nBut the tax system should not have the structural incentives that currently excessively favour the holding of assets as the path to create wealth .\\nClearly this asset fixation is undermining world economies .\\nRana Foroohors in her book ‘ Makers and Takers ’ in talking about the US economy say ’ s only about 15 % of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now goes into business investment , i.e .\\ninto producing goods and services .\\nThe rest is spent buying and selling existing financial instruments .\\nThe production of goods and services is not getting the investment needed .\\nThis is also seen in the 2008 financial crisis where bailout moeny was pumped back inot the sharemarket and not used to directly stimulate the production of goods and services .\\nThis asset fixation as the path to wealth is also hugely expensive to sustain to the point it can ’ t be economic to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trillions in 2008 , and trillions again in 2020 and recently with the Bank of England , billions bailing out Liz Truss .\\nThis money could have been better spent on actually providing needed goods and services for ordinary people and transitioning our economy to deal with the climate crisis .\\nAnd not dealing with that crisis will collapse the economy .\\nAll these problems apply to New Zealand as our economy is integrated with and largely follows others .\\nWe can see the holding asset problem in our fixation with property as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the excellent action of removing interest deductibility for rentals but then botched the policy by allowing ‘ build to rent ’ rent for life businesses to have interest deductibility for more than just building a rental .\\nThe ordinary New Zealand taxpayer is now subsiding these ‘ build to rent ’ , rent for life businesses to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars and potentially billions of dollars in lost tax revenue .\\nAnd business people will not provide affordable housing , they must maximise profit .\\nSo government accomodation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking hundreds of millions more .\\nThe stupidity and economic illiteracy of Labour on this is ….reflects poorly on their strategic thinking .\\nBut for change to remove the flaws from the tax system ; what really is to fear for the wealthy ?\\nBy itself these changes to fix the flaws in the tax system would leave wealth with the wealthy which would give them a massive capacity to adapt .\\nBut adapt they would have to .\\nI do not reject wealth taxes or windfall gain taxes , except that without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the tax system the holding of assets and the avoidance of tax will remain as powerful motivators for finance institutions meaning the current problems will come back again and again .\\nThe purpose of an economy is to satisfy the needs and some of the wants of all people in the economy .\\nFulfilling this purpose should be the path to wealth and the reward for effort .\\nBut our economy is failing at this central purpose , ordinary people are not getting their needs met .\\nThis is because our tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wealth creation based on the holding of assets rather than the direct supply of goods of services to people .\\nThis second path to wealth is driven by our outdated and colonial tax system which sees holding assets as likely capital and therefore non taxable , and loans against the assets can have interest deducted from tax liabilities .\\nThis second path to wealth favours the super wealthy and encourages monopoly capitalism .\\nBut with mega concentrations of wealth the economy gets more separated from the provisions of needs for ordinary people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mega rich .\\nYes , business loans taken out based on asset values are used to support and grow businesses but the structure is unstable and dependent on asset values being high or remaining high .\\nWhen the asset values fall massive amounts of investment capital is being diverted into the unproductive purpose of supporting asset values and not helping people get what they need .\\nThis secondary path to wealth ( holding assets ) is unstable and hugely expensive to maintain .\\nIt is also building an inertia and lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inability of many business people to adapt and accept the need for change to deal with the climate crisis .\\nTo fix this fundamental flaw in our economy , a second path to wealth , is relatively easy , and could be done without international agreements .\\nIt involves simple easy to administer fixes to our tax system .\\nLet ’ s fix the tax laws which will fix the fundamental flaw in our economy .\\n* I have written how to implement the changes to the tax systems in my article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Daily Blog .\\nI discuss impacts and benefits from these quite simple changes .\\nAnd they will close a lot of tax avoidance loopholes .\\nThese changes could also see tax rates significantly drop but more revenue collected .\\n** The usual defence of the sharemarket and holding asset values high is that everybody ’ s superannuation fund relies on assets and the sharemarkets so we all benefit .\\nTrue but a few benefit much more than others on this .',\n",

       "  'content': 'A tragic day of mourning .\\nThousands thronged the West Papuan funeral cortège yesterday and last night as the banned Morning Star led the way in defiance of the Indonesian military .\\nThere haven ’ t been so many Papuan flags flying under the noses of the security forces since the 2019 Papuan Uprising .\\nFilep Jacob Semuel Karma , 63 , the “ father ” of the Papuan nation , was believed to be the one leader who could pull together the splintered factions seeking self-determination and independence .\\n• Filep Karma : A Papuan human rights hero and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still shocking a day after his lifeless body in a wetsuit was found on a Jayapura beach .\\nPolice and Filep Karma ’ s family say they had no reason to believe that his death resulted from foul play , report Jubi editor Victor Mambor in Jayapura and Nazarudin Latif from Jakarta for Benar News .\\n“ I followed the post-mortem process and it was determined that my father died from drowning while diving , ” Karma ’ s daughter , Andrefina Karma , told reporters .\\nBut many human rights advocates and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Speculation on reasons Some are speculating about the reasons why peaceful former political prisoner Filep Karma was perceived to be an obstruction for Jakarta ’ s “ development ” plans for the Melanesian provinces .\\n“ There were too many strange circumstances around his death and questioning police ’ s influence on the family .\\nWe are not accepting this as an accident , ” declared Indonesian human rights Veronica Koman in a tweet .\\nShe says Filep Karma was so respected by West Papuans that he could have unified all factions .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation in the making – similar to Theys Eluay who was assassinated in 2001 , ” she said .\\n“ Indonesia would like to prevent this .\\nAn independent investigation must take place into his death.\\n” Koman noted that while Indonesian human rights defenders shared their condolences , there was silence from the Jakarta state establishment .\\nAmnesty International has also called for an independent investigation .\\nTributes pour in Tributes have poured in from many of his friends , colleagues and fellow activists across Indonesia and the Pacific .\\nIndonesia researcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : “ Filep Karma ’ s humour , integrity , and moral courage was an inspiration to many people .\\nHis death is a huge loss , not only for Papuans , but for many people across Indonesia and the Pacific who have lost a human rights hero.\\n” The Diplomat ’ s Southeast Asia editor Sebastian Strangio wrote : “ Karma trod a path that avoided the extremes of violent rebellion and acquiescence to what many Papuans view as essentially foreign rule .\\n“ Whether this approach ever would have achieved Karma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autonomy for the Papuan people is unclear , but his passing will clearly leave a large vacuum.\\n” He was a former civil servant who , dismayed at how many Indonesian state officials treated West Papuans , spurned a good salary to dedicate his life to West Papua .\\nAlthough standing for “ justice , democracy , peace and non-violent resistance , he was jailed for 11 years for raising the Morning Star flag .\\nOne of the most comprehensive tributes to Karma was offered by Benny Wenda , leader of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , saying that the day was a “ national day of mourning for the West Papuan people — all of us , whether in the bush , in the cities , in the refugee camps , or in exile ” .\\n‘ Great leader ’ “ Filep Karma was a great leader and a great man , ” says Wenda .\\n“ Across his life , he held many roles and won many accolades — he was a ULMWP Minister for Indonesian and Asian affairs , a Nobel Peace Prize nominee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Indonesian jail .\\n“ But he was first of all a frontline leader , present at every single protest , reassuring and inspiring all West Papuans who marched or prayed with him .\\n“ Filep was there at the Biak Massacre in 1998 , when 200 Papuans , many of them children , were murdered by the Indonesian military .\\nDespite being shot several times in the leg that day , his experience of Indonesian brutality never daunted him .\\n“ He continued to lead the struggle for liberation , whether in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The history of our struggle lived within him.\\n” ‘ How did he die ?\\n’ Now Benny Wenda says : “ The big question is this : how did Filep die ?\\n” ( He reportedly died while surfing despite being a skilled diver . )\\n“ Indonesia systematically eliminates West Papuans who fight against their occupation .\\nSometimes they will kill us in public , like Theys Eluay and Arnold Ap , who was murdered and his body dumped on the same beach Filep died on.\\n” But Wenda adds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to “ die in mysterious ways ” or face character assassination , as in the case of Papua Governor Lukas Ensemble .\\nFilip Karma was a courageous and inspirational man of peace .\\nHowever , tonight at the funeral procession in Jayapura , many have been singing : “ Because Papua wants to be free .\\n.\\n.',\n",

       "  'content': 'ON HIS “ POLITIK ” WEBSITE , Richard Harman reveals how Environment Minister David Parker upset the co-governance project .\\nLabour ’ s Māori Caucus saw co-governance becoming a central feature of Parker ’ s Natural & Built Environments Bill – the legislation poised to replace the Resource Management Act .\\nOn the all-important regional bodies established by the legislation , it was assumed that 50 percent of the seats would be reserved for Māori , leaving the rest for the rest .\\nAccording to Harman , Parker refused : successfully facing-down the opposition of Nanaia Mahuta and the Māori @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a defining move by the Government , which has been under fire over the Three Waters co-governance proposals.\\n” While Harman is undoubtedly correct to interpret Parker ’ s successful resistance as an important straw in the wind , it would be wrong to count it as a total victory .\\nAs Harman , himself , went on to report , the proposed clause in the Natural & Built Environments Bill which states : “ that in achieving the purpose of this Act , those exercising functions and powers under it must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tiriti o Waitangi ” , remains intact .\\nIt is important to remember that the co-governance project is justified as a way of giving effect to the principles of the Treaty .\\nFifty-fifty representation is promoted as the political expression of the supposed Treaty “ partnership ” .\\nThe Natural & Built Environments Bill isn ’ t out of the woods yet .\\nEven so , the fact that a Labour cabinet minister has taken a stand against co-governance – with the support of both a Cabinet and a caucus majority – is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labour , the co-governance project could never have progressed so far .\\nIf Parker ’ s stand is emulated by other Labour MPs , then co-governance will be stopped in its tracks .\\nNeither the Greens nor the Māori Party have the numbers to push it forward against Labour resistance .\\nWhat Harman ’ s reporting makes clear is the alarm which even rumours of Parker ’ s resistance generated .\\nThe Māori Council and their corporate iwi allies – represented by the former National Party Attorney-General , Chris Finlayson – took their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal niceties prevented the Tribunal from releasing a definitive judgement on co-governance and the Natural & Built Environments Bill , it did suggest that its absence from the legislation would be undesirable .\\nClearly , the Tribunal has become an integral part of the co-governance political machinery , a body of sufficient mana to offer cover for both the project and its political sponsors .\\nThe same applies to much of the media , academia , and – more worryingly – the courts .\\nAnd yet , even this impressive line-up of allies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was openly repudiated by a Government .\\nHow far would the co-governance project have proceeded had John Key not agreed to ratify the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples ?\\nHow could the Treaty ’ s “ principles ” , and its expectations of “ partnership ” , have been embedded in so many Acts of Parliament had not successive governments declined to take issue with them ?\\nThe co-governance project may not be the historical offspring of senior National and Labour politicians ( like Geoff Palmer and Chris Finlayson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which it was conceived .\\nOnly now , and only to thoughtfully stubborn individuals like David Parker , is the extraordinary naivete and arrogance required to facilitate the co-governance project becoming clear .\\nIt simply did not occur to those Pakeha politicians who set about creating a Māori middle-class to keep the increasingly fractious Māori underclass from setting the country on fire , that their creation might one day turn on its creator .\\nLocating cultural and ideological enemies at the very heart of the colonial state was never likely to produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolutionaries from the strategic locations they have occupied in the course of their “ long march through the institutions ” is not going to be easy .\\nJudges , in particular , can not be removed without a great deal of fuss .\\nIdeologically-driven public servants , academics , teachers and journalists are similarly well-placed to defend the “ gains ” of the racial revolution .\\nAnd then there ’ s the younger generations of New Zealanders .\\nThese youngsters may not be intellectually or emotionally equipped to challenge the radical orthodoxy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than equal to the task of inflicting a lot of harm on their behalf .\\nAll of which adds up to a difficult and potentially dangerous mission should Mr Parker and his Labour comrades agree to accept it .\\nThey will have to re-learn both the liberal-democratic catechism of universal human-rights and freedoms ( the freedom of expression in particular ) as well as the good old democratic-socialist creed that bound the Labour Party and the Ratana Church together so tightly all those years ago .\\nFortunately , they have at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\n1 ) Most New Zealanders – Māori and Pakeha – do not want co-governance .\\n2 ) The electorate will reward any government that has the guts to say : “ This far , but no further !\\n”',\n",

       "  'content': 'The National Business Review reported a comment by New Zealand ’ s then National Party government minister of finance Bill English on August 15 , 2014 , that he had occasionally pointed out in speeches to business audiences that New Zealand has had post World War Two recessions roughly every 10 years : in 1957-58 ; 1967-68 ; the mid-1970s ; the mid-1980s ; 1997-98 and 2007-8 .\\nHe would observe laconically : “ You ’ d think we would see them coming.\\n” But of course bourgeois economists , commentators and journalists don ’ t generally see them coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sometimes the Marxist critics of capitalism see them coming a little too often .\\nBut it is a simple fact of life that capitalism has had economic crises on a periodic basis at least since 1825 .\\nEvery 10 years or so , capitalism goes through a cycle of boom and bust .\\nThe following charts for the US economy illustrate this reality .\\nThey have been taken from an important paper by US Marxist economist Anwar Shaikh entitled : Profitability , Long Waves and the Recurrence of General Crises Capitalism also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cycles of boom and bust are more pronounced one way or another .\\nThat is , capitalism goes through periods of several decades such as the post-World War II “ long boom ” involving multiple cycles where the upturns are relatively stronger than the downturns .\\nSimilarly there are other periods such as the decades following the crisis of 1873 where the upward phases of the cycle are relatively weak and the downward phases more pronounced .\\nUnderstanding these cyclical fluctuations is also closely connected to another element of Marxist theory that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historical materialism – which is simply a way of viewing and understanding history .\\nSocieties , ever since we humans began generating a consistent surplus , have been divided into classes where each class is defined by its relationship to the means and mode of production .\\nThe legal , political , social and cultural elements of society arise from this economic foundation .\\nThe relations and modes of production , which determine how the economic system is produced and reproduced , have gone through various stages as technology and the forces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been slavery , feudalism , capitalism and the beginning efforts to construct socialism .\\nEconomic systems do not pass away until they have exhausted their progressive functions in terms of increasing society ’ s productive capacity , which in turn enables population growth and cultural development .\\nWhen the growth of the productive forces reaches a certain limit within the framework of the existing society , the question is posed : Can the fetters of the existing social relations be thrown off and a new society established ?\\nMarx devoted his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capitalism .\\nThis was the question from his point of view .\\nDecades of research , decades of writing , decades of reflection – in between throwing himself into labour struggles and the odd revolution when they were happening .\\nBut he always returned to this basic task .\\nThe key questions for Marx were understanding why capitalism operates the way it does and whether capitalism is a historically limited system – whether it will reach a limit and need to be superseded .\\nMarx ’ s answers are to be found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as Capital .\\nOur inability , so far , to supersede capitalism on a world scale means that periodic crises return again and again , each one causing great hardship while also giving a powerful impetus to the centralisation of capital and the growth of monopoly domination .\\nThe system ’ s dependence on relentless expansion over time and its inherent drive to maximise profit rather than meet human needs means that we now face the incompatibility of this system with our coexistence with Mother Earth .\\nThat has become an element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ – demonstrating the increasing incompatibility between a livable environment and the way the system is organised through private property and ownership .\\nThe crises , therefore , tend to get bigger , more prolonged and more socially destabilising .\\nI think we have entered with the 2007-08 world recession , the weak recovery following and now the post Covid boom and bust in rapid succession , a new opening of a prolonged period of crises like that .\\nBut there is no final crisis in this system – other than a descent into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sort of ecological winter or runaway ecological collapse that capitalism appears to be preparing for us .\\nShort of such a disastrous outcome , the system will continue to carry on with its booms and busts until it is overthrown and replaced .\\nThat can only be carried out by a conscious social and political force , by a class that is not bound to the system by material interest .\\nThat is why the working class is the only class that can overthrow this system .\\nIt is the only class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its perpetuation .\\nIt is the only class with the numbers and social power , if organised , if conscious enough , to effect this outcome and bring about real majority rule .\\nThe problem faced by Marx was that the challenge he took on in his writing of Capital was so daunting that all we got during his lifetime was the first part of a planned six-part work .\\nMarx published a volume 1 which was part of his planned first volume in several editions .\\nEngels , using Marx ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as volumes 2 and 3 after Marx ’ s death .\\nThen there was the Theories of Surplus Value – a part of a rough draft of a history of economic thought .\\nAll of that was originally going to be the first volume of the planned six-part project .\\nThere were to be additional volumes on wage labour , the state , and competition .\\nThe entire work was to culminate in the volume on the world market .\\nIt was there logically that crises were to be dealt with in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with crises except in scattered references , mostly in volume 3 of Capital and in his correspondence .\\nMarx ’ s method was to begin at the most abstract level before moving progressively to the more concrete .\\nIn Capital he begins with the abstract categories of the commodity and value and moves through to the formation of prices and the role of money and the market .\\nHe goes on to explain the origin of profit in surplus value and ties this all in with the origin of capitalism in what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment of things like exchange rates , world trade and so on were to come later .\\nThere was an added problem with what we know as volume 2 , published after Marx ’ s death .\\nVolume 2 is actually more a volume about how capitalism works rather than how it doesn ’ t .\\nMarx explains how capitalism must be a system of expanded reproduction and he presents formulas to prove that is how it must exist and in a sense how it can exist .\\nThere was a certain consternation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume 2 was published .\\nThe revolutionary ideas of Marx and Engels were already under attack within German Social Democracy , the German workers ’ party at the time , which was led by followers of Marx and Engels .\\nVolume 2 was used by critics of these revolutionary ideas to “ prove ” that capitalism worked and could last indefinitely – in support of the views of the reformist wing of German Social Democracy led by Eduard Bernstein .\\nBecause the cause of crises wasn ’ t fully spelt out in Marx @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rosa Luxemburg started to look for explanations for why crises happen that didn ’ t quite fit in with the logic of what Marx and Engels had written .\\nShe looked at the exhaustion of the world market .\\nOthers , like Henryk Grossman , looked at things like the tendency of the rate of profit to fall , which was viewed as a long-term historical tendency by Marx .\\nThis logic of Marx ’ s method can today be deduced not only from their major economic works but also from their journalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and analysed actual crises until Marx ’ s death in 1883 and Engels ’ in 1895 .\\nCapitalism has also changed significantly since Marx and Engels wrote .\\nThese changes need to be incorporated into our understanding of crises today .\\nThe system has evolved from industrial capitalism based on free competition to monopoly capitalism .\\nWe have been through the Great Depression of the 1930s .\\nWe have had the experience of the “ Keynesian revolution ” .\\nWe have had the Monetarist counter-revolution inspited by US economist Milton Freidman and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have also had an end of the international gold standard , a very important event .\\nWe had the stagflation of the 1970s , and the neoliberal turn in the 1980s .\\nMost recently , we have had the global “ Great Recession ” of 2007-2009 , followed by an unprecedentedly weak recovery , anaemic at best for most of the world .\\nMonetarism appeared to be abandoned briefly in favour of Keynesianism again in order to confront the Covid crisis only to be reimposed to crush the inflation unleashed in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renewed global recession that threatens a return of a great depression .\\nThis is because the weak recovery after 2008 still required an enormous explosion of debt .\\nThis was followed by the inflationary money printing to cope with the Covid-19 crisis that will require interest rates we haven ’ t seen in decades to bring under control .\\nThat , in turn , will provoke a cascade of debt and broader financial crises across the globe .',\n",

bitterness and strife .\\nWhile the determination of right-wing New Zealanders to defeat the Labour Government will only be strengthened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voters of the centre-left will feel increasingly

.\\nThe Right ’ s supporters , by contrast , are energised by their political opponents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more outrageous escalations of their own .\\nThe fear inspired by these tactics is even less conducive to normal political engagement .\\nVoters shut their doors against the unpleasantness and determine to have nothing to do with the extremists on both sides .\\nThe dynamic was memorably

right-wing voters against them , its all-too-evident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the cost of living , health , education , housing and criminal offending will be having the opposite effect on the voters in its heartland .\\nAmong Labour ’ s “ base ” , expectations have been high that the changes promised by the party since 2017 will make their lives easier .\\nThat these changes – at least on the “ transformational ” scale suggested by the Prime Minister – have not eventuated , can not help but contribute to a mood of disillusionment among “ Jacinda ’ s ” most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the results of a survey commissioned by Stuff Media , fully 35 percent of those asked how the Prime Minister made them feel , responded by saying she made them feel “ disappointed ” .\\nA third replied “ concerned ”

.\\nIn fact , it has done the opposite , taking every opportunity to distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its admiration for the heroes of the Labour Movement , Michael Joseph Savage and Norman Kirk .\\nTo older Labour supporters , this is quite simply baffling , and not a little irritating .\\nMany of them lived through the government of Norman Kirk , and are well aware that Jacinda Ardern ’ s period in

       "  'content': 'Chris Trotter on 3 November wrote ‘ David Parker rejects Co-Governance ’ .\\nIt ’ s more likely that Mr Parker is just following up on his early declaration that the revision of the resource management process is purely a procedural pull together and no policy changes are planned to be part of this process .\\nCo-governance would be a policy change .\\nHowever , the articles premise is co-governance is at variance with both ‘ the liberal-democratic catechism of universal human-rights and freedoms ( the freedom of expression in particular ) as well as the good old democratic-socialist creed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ratana Church together ’ .\\nThis is simply not true .\\nThere is nothing inherently anti-democratic or racist in co-goverance .\\nIf it is then many existing , laws , diplomatic treaties or trade treaties are anti-democratic and racist , i.e.\\n, they were written mostly by older white pakeha business men with a business perspective , advancing those perspectives ; and if this is racist or anti democratic I don ’ t hear a lot of media or political talk about it .\\nCo-governance is in the Treaty and it is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we like it or not .\\nSupporting co-governance is nothing about ‘ woke ’ politics but it is about being literate enough to read .\\nArticles 2 and 3 of the Treaty confirm and protect property rights for Maori .\\nCo-governance could be seen as simple consultation over property rights , and consultation is what happens now with changes that affect property rights for any New Zealander .\\nTherefore to deny co-governance to Maori is to deny fundamental recognition of their property rights as provided for in the Treaty and embed pakeha dominance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and not just in english common law .\\nThat distinction is best seen in how Maori collective ownership structures were deliberately and systematically undermined by the government appointed Land Courts .\\nCollective ownership was specifically respected under the Treaty but the courts broke that down for sales .\\nIt could be argued almost all decisions of the land courts can be overturned as they contradict the Treaty .\\nBy contrast european models of collective ownership , companies and Trusts , were favoured .\\nAnd history shows that a few Maori MP ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect Maori land property rights .\\nAnd this dominance will continue without co-goverance , or at the very least a better constitution than we have now .\\nIn terms of co-governance impacts on democracy , and this seems to be the area of concern in the article ; I can ’ t see it .\\nWithout the identification of a problem its hard to discuss the impact .\\nSo let ’ s do a few thought experiments .\\nSo for 3 waters the cynical might well say Maori will just see the board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their elites .\\nI am not in a position to know or comment on how transparent or democratic processes are in any Maori groups .\\nThere certainly does seem to be some problems at times , e.g.\\n, Shelly Bay in Wellington is recorded as sold but many Maori had voted not to sell .\\nSo perhaps they need to consider changes in process , constitutions ?\\nBut like a private company I can ’ t tell them what to do .\\nAnd where is the impact on my democratic rights ?\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression .\\nThe much vaunted local body election accountability rights are a farce .\\nIn Wellington we had multiple Mayors , almost all of a conservative bent , elected by claiming to be fiscally careful and focused on essential infrastructure .\\nIt was all lies .\\nThey left before we found out about our underfunded and failing infrastructure , so there is no accountability .\\nWhen it comes to specific knowledge and skill sets , e.g.\\n, on fresh water and sewage , society has to rely on experts and voting does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old days we had bureaucrats looking after our electricity network and on the whole they did it really well for a fraction of the cost to the currently largely privately owned model .\\nThe democratic control was exercised at a higher national level .\\nIn another utility ;

and not just in english common law .\\nThat distinction is best seen in how Maori collective ownership structures were deliberately and systematically undermined by the government appointed Land Courts .\\nCollective ownership was specifically respected under the Treaty but the courts broke that down for sales .\\nIt could be argued almost all decisions of the land courts can be overturned as they contradict the Treaty .\\nBy contrast european models of collective ownership , companies and Trusts , were favoured .\\nAnd history shows that a few Maori MP ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect Maori land property rights .\\nAnd this dominance will continue without co-goverance , or at the very least a better constitution than we have now .\\nIn terms of co-governance impacts on democracy , and this seems to be the area of concern in the article ;

       "  'content': 'Last week I began this three-part series to help understand what is happening to the world economy today and why pro-capitalist economists are completely unable to explain it .\\nToday I look at the conflicting Marxist explanations of the crisis that are common today and why they have departed from Karl Marx ’ s explanation in “ Capital ” and it helps if we go back to Marx and his explanation that all crises are generalised crises of overproduction to find a proper understanding of the crisis .\\nMarx had identified the essence of the periodic crises of capitalism as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even in the Communist Manifesto in 1848 .\\nThis crisis can only happen because production periodically exceeds monetarily effective demand , which is ultimately determined by the existing size and growth rate of the global hoard of the money commodity – gold .\\nI am emphasising this because there has been a retreat from this analysis , including among followers of Marx .\\nIn fact , the two main schools of Marxist crisis theory today are not schools based on periodic overproduction crises .\\nOne school is based on the primacy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall ( TROPF ) .\\nMarx introduced this idea in volume 3 of “ Capital ” as an important long-term historical tendency in capitalism .\\nMarx also pointed out many counter tendencies , but the tendency is true over long periods .\\nMany Marxist economists use that important theory as the primary explanation for why capitalism has crises .\\nThis school of thought is associated with the , the prolific , and British theorists from the Trotskyist tradition including the British Socialist Workers Party ( SWP ) leader .\\nAll three writers deserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to learn from their writings .\\nBut the almost monomaniacal attachment to the TROPF to explain crises leads them astray .\\nMichael Roberts even tries to explain the 10-year cycle under capitalism as the result of the fall in the rate of profit .\\nIt is , of course , true that every crisis is associated with a fall in the rate of profit , but that temporary decline is a result of the crisis , not the cause .\\nCallinicos seems unable to explain the real growth of capitalism since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have been the result of the TROPF , and since there has been no counter tendency big enough to overcome the falling rate of profit sufficiently , the crisis must be permanent .\\nHowever , the world economy has more than doubled in size in that period , and we have seen an explosive growth in capitalist production in China , which he fails to properly account for in his theories .\\nThe other significant school of thought is associated with the magazine and its editor .\\nFoster is an important writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as a leading theorist on the relevance of Marxism to understanding today ’ s ecological challenges .\\nThe Monthly Review school is very influenced by Keynesian ideas .\\nJohn Maynard Keynes was a pro-capitalist economist who became very influential in the wake of the Great Depression of the 1930s .\\nTraditional bourgeois economic theory denied that capitalism could have crises .\\nKeynes had been schooled in this theory but , when faced with the crisis of the 1930s , was forced to acknowledge the reality staring him in the face .\\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact , it seemed to him to have a tendency towards stagnation .\\nBut he believed the state could intervene to alleviate crises , if not eliminate them altogether .\\nSo from a Keynesian point of view , you can not have a crisis of overproduction .\\nRather , with Keynes , you have a crisis of under-consumption that can be resolved by the state stepping in to purchase goods directly or printing money to give people to spend themselves and/or using government deficit spending to put more money into the economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ending the gold standard was to allow this to happen more easily .\\nOverproduction as the underlying cause of crises , which is based on Marx ’ s concept of money as the universal equivalent , has been – especially since the end of what remained of the international gold standard in 1971 – all but forgotten , including by most of those claiming to be Marxist .\\nCapitalism requires a measure of value that is itself a commodity Classical political economy represented by Adam Smith and David Ricardo was the science of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labour theory of value .\\nSmith ’ s “ invisible hand ” — the unobservable market force that helps the demand and supply of goods in a free market to reach equilibrium automatically — was the law of labour value in operation .\\nBut Marx also explained that what Smith and Ricardo called “ labour ” was actually “ labour power ” or the ability to work .\\nBut a capitalist won ’ t employ labour unless the worker is able to produce more value in a workday than what they are paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the origin of all forms of profit and drives the invisible hand .\\nThis made Marx ’ s ideas a revolutionary advance on classical political economy and forced the capitalists to abandon the science of political economy .\\nA central part of Marx ’ s perfected labour theory of value was that it requires – as does commodity production as a system – a measure of value that is itself a commodity .\\nUltimately , gold emerged as the main money commodity because it is durable , contains a significant value ( amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time ) in a small quantity , and is easily divisible .\\nHowever , it can only be a measure of value because it has value as a product of labour itself , measured by its monetary use value in units of weight .\\nThe pro-capitalist alternative to that theory and Keynesian under-consumptionism is dubbed Say ’ s Law – an economic principle of early “ vulgar ” economics named after the French businessman and economist Jean-Baptiste Say ( 1767–1832 ) .\\nMarx dubbed them “ vulgar ” economists because they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was happening and instead provided simple apologies for capitalism and its laws .\\nSay stated that production creates its own demand .\\nCommodities are bought with commodities .\\nMoney plays no particular role except as an intermediary .\\nThis idea , combined with marginalism – the theory that commodities have exchange value because of their scarcity relative to human needs – tries to banish the labour theory of value by claiming things have value due to their marginal utility and that generalised overproduction of commodities is impossible .\\nEssentially , this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value .\\nMarginalism , which assumes Say ’ s Law either explicitly or implicitly , was the end of bourgeois economics as any form of science .\\nAll bourgeois economics today is built on these two false theories and can ’ t escape them .\\nThe abolition of the gold standard has created very real problems with the modern US dollar-based international monetary system , with permanent inflation , regular exchange rate crises , and so on .\\nFollowing the Bretton Woods monetary conference in 1944 up to 1971 , when Nixon took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money in everyday use nearly always had a legally fixed relationship to gold via the US dollar .\\nYou could go to a central bank and demand a certain amount of dollars for your currency , which in turn would represent a specific amount of gold , backed by the bullion hoard in Fort Knox .\\nPrior to 1933 , individuals , as well as countries , could demand gold for their paper US dollars .\\nAfter 1933 , up to 1971 , foreign governments and their central banks – but not individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the gold standard was completely abandoned , there was an assumption on the part of many Marxist economists that maybe Keynes was right on one point .\\nMaybe now you could just create money at will .\\nThe state had the power not just to create tokens representing gold but create currency at will with no relationship to gold – now supposedly “ just another commodity ” like all others with no special role .\\nThat is a big mistake .\\nUltimately , all non-commodity money – token money and credit money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real money commodity like gold .\\nThis is true whether a formal gold standard exists or not .\\nThis lawful economic relationship still exists and therefore continues to be the underlying cause of crises of overproduction .\\nWhen they started to print money at will , in the 1970s , when Nixon said , “ We are all Keynesians now ” , what you ended up with was a severe bout of inflation as printed money lost value and its fixed relationship to the money commodity , which remained gold .\\nThe “ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , it took more and more tokens to represent the same amount of gold .\\nMonetary tokens were being devalued , and inflation was the inevitable result .\\nThe nature of a crisis as an overproduction crisis was spelt out by Engels in 1873 .\\nEngels was a remarkable man .\\nHe worked managing his family business in Manchester for some decades , operating as a capitalist in the textile trade .\\nHe did that so he could keep his friend and intellectual partner free to work on “ Capital ” .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a brilliant man , but he knew there was one person – Karl Marx – who alone at that time was both willing and able to carry through the critique of bourgeois political economy .\\nEngels was willing to do whatever was necessary to enable Marx to work .\\nThe correspondence of Marx and Engels is extraordinarily rich in political and economic analysis .\\nEngels begged Marx to get on with the task of writing the book .\\nMarx promised again and again that it was just around the corner .\\nThere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Engels could give the business up , and there is a wonderful letter where he expressed his joy at being liberated from his role as an industrial capitalist .\\nEngels did a lot of writing in defence of the joint views of Marx and Engels .\\nOne of his major works was a polemical work in 1877 called against a then fashionable but now obscure German professor .\\nIt became an exposition of the mature views of Marx and Engels on a broad range of political , historical , philosophical , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of Marx ’ s major economic concepts had been developed .\\nHe even wrote a chapter of “ Anti-Duhring ” himself .\\nFor those attached to the TROPF , it is not mentioned once as a cause of crises .\\nHowever , they did write an important paragraph summarising their joint views on the origin of crises under capitalism .\\nIt reads : We have seen that the ever-increasing perfectibility of modern machinery is , by the anarchy of social production , turned into a compulsory law that forces the individual industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always to increase its productive force .\\nThe bare possibility of extending the field of production is transformed for him into a similarly compulsory law .\\nThe enormous expansive force of modern industry , compared with which that of gases is mere child ’ s play , appears to us now as a necessity for expansion , both qualitative and quantitative , that laughs at all resistance .\\nSuch resistance is offered by consumption , by sales , by the markets for the products of modern industry .\\nBut the capacity for extension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markets is primarily governed by quite different laws that work much less energetically .\\n( Emphasis added ) The extension of the markets can not keep pace with the extension of production .\\nThe collision becomes inevitable , and as this can not produce any real solution so long as it does not break in pieces the capitalist mode of production , the collisions become periodic .\\nThe problem is Engels didn ’ t spell out what these laws are that govern the capacity for growth of the markets and why they work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out that he sees the cycles of capitalism and the crises they produce as a periodic collision of two counterposed forces—the physical ability of capitalism to use modern science and technology to expand production without limit , and the different , less energetic laws governing the growth of the markets .\\nThe laws that govern the growth of markets are connected to the role of the money commodity as a measure of value and periodic changes in the relative profitability of gold production versus the production of other commodities .\\nGold is both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value , and a commodity in its own right .\\nTherefore , its production remains key to understanding the laws of capitalism that determine value , price , and profit .\\nBut if you look at the history of capitalism , there is a peculiarity about gold .\\nBecause it is the ultimate measure of value , the production of gold tends to move countercyclically to overall commodity production .\\nSo , when there is an overall boom in production in society , gold production tends to decline , and during overall depressions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase .\\nThis is an important mechanism for regulating capitalism .\\nAs prices in gold terms ( in weights of gold ) rise during the rising phase of the industrial cycle , gold ’ s purchasing power falls , gold production becomes relatively less profitable , and capital flows out of that sector , gold production slows , interest rates rise as money becomes tight , and the boom ends in a crash .\\nWhen prices in gold terms fall sharply in a crisis , gold ’ s purchasing power rises , gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital flows into the sector causing gold production to rise , adding to the growing idle money hoard resulting from the crisis itself , pushing down interest rates , and the economy recovers .\\nThe capitalist system seeks to escape the limits of monetarily effective demand by , as Marx explained some 150 years ago , expanding credit .\\nBut credit can not expand forever , even with all the modern-day miracles performed by today ’ s computers .\\nIn the end , the debt must be serviced—interest and principal paid—and eventually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise during the industrial cycle ’ s boom ( overproduction ) phase , credit collapses , and another crisis is born .',\n",

       "  'content': 'Behind the headline “ $ 200m boost for new homes ” is a sordid tale of a government demolishing state houses , selling most of the land to private property developers and in this case building fewer state houses than were previously there .\\nHousing Minister Megan Woods says the investment in East Porirua means 186 existing state houses will be demolished to be replaced by just 100 new state houses while most of the land will be sold to private property developers .\\nMeanwhile we have 25,000 on the state house waiting list , up from just over 5,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nIf a National government was doing this Megan Woods would be raging and demanding the resignation of the minister .\\nIf only .\\nThe country desperately needs an industrial-scale state house building programme but Labour is moving in the opposite direction .\\nAn answer to an Official Information Act request reveals the extent of the privatisation of state houses and crown land occurring under this government .\\nIn the last three years Labour has sold $ 131million in former state house land as well as tens of millions in state houses themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a subsequent blog ) There are six LSP ( Large Scale Projects ) being run by Kāinga Ora since 2017 – the six listed in the table below and East Porirua ( described in the first two paragraphs of this blog ) The pattern in each LSP is the same .\\nDemolish hundreds of state houses , sell most of the land to private property developers and use the proceeds to build small numbers of new state houses – small in terms of the numbers actually needed .\\nThe government ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the state house waiting list , to keep the total number of state houses at just 3.6 % of the total housing stock .\\nAnd by selling crown land to fund state house building , the government doesn ’ t have to put in a cent .\\nIn addition to the $ 131million in land sold so far , hundreds of millions more is in the pipeline .\\nAccording to Kāinga Ora the total land involved with these LSPs is 458 hectares with half this land projected to be sold to private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which would be ideal for the large-scale state house building so desperately needed .\\nI have previously described Labour ’ s sale of former state house land as the largest privatisation of state assets since the 1990s .\\nThe figures bear this out .\\nAt a time when our housing crisis for low and middle-income families has become a catastrophe ( the Salvation Army ’ s word ) the government is looking the other way .\\nThe state house waiting list has been growing at twice the rate the net number of state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to power in 2017 we had 63,315 state houses – as at June this year we have 69,509 .\\nAn average increase of just over 1200 per year for the 25,000 on the state house waiting list .\\nIt would be laughable if it wasn ’ t so tragic .',\n",

       "  'content': 'WHAT WOULD YOU THINK of a man who offered himself for high political office with the following credentials ?\\nHe was raised in humble circumstances , fought his way out of poverty and , at 44 , is a twice-decorated war hero .\\nHe does not eat meat or drink alcohol , loves animals and has an easy rapport with children .\\nNot when you hear his name .\\nNot when you discover that the man seeking your support is Adolf Hitler .\\nAnd yet , all the attributes listed above are completely factual .\\nAdolf Hitler was all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts , especially when they are stripped of context , is not the same as telling the truth .\\nTo grasp the truth of Adolf Hitler ’ s contribution to world history requires more than mere facts , it requires understanding , interpretation and judgement .\\nWhen the Prime Minister , Jacinda Ardern , addressed her party ’ s annual conference on 6 November 2022 , she cloaked herself in the legacy of the Labour leaders who had preceded her .\\nThis is what she said : “ On the 9th floor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly behind my desk , is a picture of Michael Joseph Savage .\\nYou could say he ’ s on my shoulder but also ever so slightly in my ear .\\n“ Of course it was Savage and the first Labour Government that lifted New Zealand out of the depths of the Great Depression .\\nNot by cutting taxes and services , but by investing in jobs , and building a social welfare safety net .\\nThey built the country ’ s first state home .\\nAnd not long after these social reforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were among some of the highest in the world .\\nNot for the few , but for the many .\\n“ The Finance Minister who supported Savage , Walter Nash , then led Labour ’ s second government as it continued to build our nation ’ s social welfare system , while advocating on the world stage for peace over war after World War 2 .\\n“ It was Norman Kirk and a Labour government who tilted the country towards a modern future with reforms of trade , health , the arts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foster a renewed national identity and partnership with Maōri – all the while challenging global evil such as apartheid and nuclear testing .\\n“ It was a fight David Lange continued , making New Zealand nuclear free , while also righting the wrongs of the past by legalising homosexuality , and fully abolishing the death penalty.\\n” There are many facts embedded in the PM ’ s speech , but precious little truth .\\nIt is certainly a fact that the Second Labour Government was led by Walter Nash , but to suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pacifist visionary is very far from the truth .\\nNash was 75 years old when he became Prime Minister in 1957 and was a notorious prevaricator and procrastinator .\\nThe two Labour Ministers who drove the Second Labour Government were Finance Minister , Arnold Nordmeyer , and the Trade & Industry Minister , Phil Holloway .\\nInspiring these two men was a third – the senior public servant and left-wing intellectual , Bill Sutch .\\nKnowing these things about the Second Labour Government , being able to put Nash and his colleagues into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present-day member of the Labour Party a radically different perspective on the possibilities of social-democratic government .\\nSadly , Ardern did not want to share even a small measure of the truth about those three years .\\nHer only concern was to establish her place in the line of succession .\\nPoor Norman Kirk fares little better .\\nOn the basis of the PM ’ s summary , the Third Labour Government could easily be presented as laying the groundwork for the Fourth .\\nThe truth is , of course , very different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like his Australian counterpart , Gough Whitlam , was determined to extend and expand the Labour accomplishments of the 1930s and 40s .\\nIn other words , Kirk ’ s government represented the antithesis of Lange ’ s .\\nThe Fourth Labour Government made New Zealand safe for neoliberalism by dismantling everything that the First , Second and Third Labour Government ’ s had built .\\nArdern ’ s impossibly brief sketch of the Fourth Labour Government , in which Lange champions the anti-nuclear policy , decriminalises homosexuality , and “ finally ” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lying by omission .\\nLange initially attempted to water-down the anti-nuclear strategy , and then made sure he was as far from Wellington as possible when the critical decision to either admit or deny entry to a visiting US warship could no longer be put off .\\nThe decriminalisation of homosexuality was effected by a private members bill in the name of Fran Wilde on a conscience vote .\\nIt was not a government bill , and Lange had nothing to do with it .\\nThe big battle over the death penalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before Lange became PM .\\nIt was accomplished under a National Party government in 1961 .\\nAll that the Fourth Labour Government abolished , thanks to Sir Geoffrey Palmer ( not Lange ) was the death penalty for treason in time of war .\\nArdern ’ s reference to the Fourth Labour Government shows just how much of the truth can be obscured through the presentation of a few highly dubious “ facts ” .\\nHad she been of a mind to speak honestly to her party , she could have explained to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been accomplished on her watch is because the Fourth Labour Government quite consciously decided to disempower the state , and had carefully dismantled all the machinery that made it possible for previous Labour Governments to make New Zealand a better place .\\nIt is entirely possible that Ardern approves of David Lange ’ s and Roger Douglas ’ s “ reforms ” .\\nCertainly , neither she , nor her Finance Minister , Grant Robertson , have seen fit to roll back the neoliberal revolution which the Lange/Douglas partnership began .\\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as she doesn ’ t then pretend to be one more gleaming crimson link in the long democratic-socialist chain that begins with Harry Holland in 1919 !\\nThe Labour Party does not like to be criticised and is fiercely protective of its leaders .\\nOver the years it has discovered that the best form of defence is to personally attack all those who draw attention to its shortcomings .\\nCrucial to the success of this strategy , however , is the fostering within its ranks of a pervasive political amnesia , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historical ignorance .\\nThe measure of these Labour apparatchiks ’ success is that , to date , not one party member has dared to protest the Prime Minister ’ s grotesque misrepresentation of the Labour governments which preceded her own .\\nThere is so much that the Labour Party could learn from its past .\\nSo much courage that could be drawn from the men and women who refused to be told that their plans were beyond the scope of practical politics .\\nPeople who didn ’ t have to pretend to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ Let ’ s do this !\\n” – and then did it .',\n",

course to be the deadliest year for Palestinians in the West Bank since the systematic tracking of Palestinian fatalities began in 2005 .\\nIncreasing illegal settler violence and sabotage , noted during the reporting period , 17 June to 20 September 2022 , is reinforcing Israeli military aggression and population-control .\\nFor Palestinians , the deaths , injuries and dispossession are creating mounting hopelessness , anger and appeals for justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 32 Palestinians , including six children , were killed by Israeli security forces during protests , home invasions and searches , while 311 of them , including one woman and eight children , were injured .\\nIsraeli settlers and their supporters perpetrated 106 attacks against Palestinians , resulting in 63 injuries and damage to Palestinian property .\\nSince the beginning of October until 6 November , Israel carried out 22 Gaza ceasefire violations , targeting fishing boats , agriculture and communities .\\nOn 26 October , Israeli gunboats opened fire on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ al-Sudaniya , hijacking one vessel and taking prisoner five crew members .\\nOn 31 October , the Israeli Navy opened fire on Palestinian fishing vessels off Gaza City , and hijacked two of them as well as taking four people prisoner .\\nOccasional Resistance to the Israeli blockade is only to be expected and , on the evening of 4 November three missiles were fired in two failed Palestinian attacks .\\nAll three missiles fell inside the Gaza Strip .\\nNevertheless , by 3:30am , five Israeli air raids had launched a total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refugee camp in Central Gaza .\\nThe UN Representative for France noted that Israel ’ s land-grabbing settlement policy manifested contempt for international law and human rights .\\nAlien settlement evicts Palestinians from their homes , even forcing them to demolish their own houses .\\nSettlers have complete freedom of movement , while Palestinians are subjected to severe restrictions of movement .\\nNorway ’ s UN delegate drew particular attention to the increasing number of Palestinian children abducted by Israeli forces and subjected to physical violence as well as incarceration .\\nThere were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the need to support the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees ( UNRWA ) as well as , in line with Security Council Resolution 1860 , the total lifting of Israel ’ s Gaza blockade .\\nGreat Power world leaders and the mainstream news media continue to remain silent concerning Israel ‘ s brazen violations of all United Nations and Security Council resolutions regarding abuses of Palestinian human rights .\\nNoting the sharp increase in settler violence with Israeli Army complicity , especially now against olive harvesters , Caít @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Palestinians , living and farming in the Occupied West Bank , have the right to go about their daily lives without fear of violence or intimidation .\\nFor around 20 years now , subscribers have been receiving my news reports based upon daily sitreps produced by the Palestine Liberation Organisation ( PLO ) .\\nWhile the sitreps can never be up-to-date and are often released by the PLO in groups , rather than singly , they do provide a daily record of the relentless persecution suffered by Palestinians under Zionist Occupation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily newsletters has become even more time-consuming because of the growing frequency of Israel ’ s injustices and atrocities .\\nFor example , at the beginning of the last quarter of 2022 , the headlines on the first day of October were : Jerusalem – 16:00 , Israeli Occupation forces shot and killed a motorcyclist travelling behind a military vehicle in al-Eizariya .\\nJerusalem – 18:30 , Israeli forces , firing live ammunition , rubber-coated bullets , stun grenades and tear gas canisters , raided and patrolled al-Eizariya , killing 18-year-old Mohammed Khaled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17-year-old youth : Abdul Aziz Mohammed Erekat .\\nRamallah – 06:35 , the Israeli Army opened fire on a motor vehicle , near the Rantis checkpoint .\\nRamallah – 22:15 , Israeli checkpoint troops severely beat up an ambulance driver , Firas Ayoub Samara , at the entrance to Beit Ur al-Tahta .\\nTulkarem – 13:10 , the Israeli Army seized a bulldozer , being used for work in Quffin .\\nIsraeli Army armed robbery and assault with stun grenades and tear gas canisters : Nablus – 15:30 , Israeli soldiers , firing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Masoudia checkpoint , near Burqa village , robbed a National Security Force Officer , Iyad Salah , of his uniform .\\nNablus – 23:15 , Israelis , from the Yitzhar Occupation settlement , laid waste to crops on Burin village land .\\nSalfit – 13:20 , a gang of Israeli settlers severely beat up a 62-year-old farmer , Rabah Ayoub Ali Ahmed , while he was working on his land near Kafr al-Dik .\\nIt is shameful that the mainstream news media almost never report the daily crimes committed by Israeli Occupation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Zionist regime has reason to believe that it can forever rely on the impunity it has been afforded .\\nThis year , a formal complaint was filed with the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) , regarding Israel ‘ s “ systematic targeting ” of Palestinian journalists and labelling its failure to investigate their deaths as war crimes .\\nIsrael also kills unarmed Palestinian residents and regularly opens live-fire on protesters .\\nArmed Palestinian Resistance fighters are killed even after having been wounded and disarmed .\\nYet occasionally , the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Shireen Abu Akleh , the Palestinian-American Reporter killed by raiding Israeli forces in Jenin last May , have welcomed a US decision to look into her death .\\nInvestigations by The Washington Post and The New York Times , as well as the United Nations , have concluded that Israeli forces killed her .\\nNevertheless , Israel , whose military Occupation and population-control of Palestinians is so heavily financed by the USA , remains obdurate .\\nInstead of accepting responsibility and apologising to the family , the Israeli Defence Minister , Benny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not co-operate ” with any US investigation , describing the enquiry as “ interference in Israel ’ s internal affairs.\\n” On 11 November , the United Nations ’ Decolonisation Committee adopted a draft Palestinian resolution , requesting an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice ( ICJ ) on Israel ’ s 55 years of colonising military Occupation .\\nSince 2002 , UNESCO has documented 21 both professional and other journalists , who have died in Occupied Palestine and Israel .\\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists has also ted 25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nKeeping silent about racist war crimes assists and encourages Israel while shamefully disrespecting and betraying the news reporters who lost their lives in attempting to reveal them .\\nThe journalists , who are still risking their lives to report the truth from Palestine , deserve to be listened to .\\nWe have a right to be informed .',\n",

       "  'title': 'Why Marx was right about capitalism needing to have periodic crises (Part 3 of 3)',\n",
       "  'content': 'Two weeks ago I began this three-part series to help understand what is happening to the world economy today and why pro-capitalist economists are completely unable to explain it .\\nLast week I looked at the conflicting Marxist explanations of the crisis that are common today and why they have departed from Karl Marx ’ s explanation in “ Capital ” .\\nToday , I want to point people to some of the best explanations available today of what can be called “ crisis theory ” .\\nIn the last decade , I have been working with a small group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing a blog focused on economics that I highly recommend .\\nIt is called A Critique of Crisis Theory .\\nWhat I have been explaining here are essentially based on their ideas .\\nThe blogs first 40 or so posts are being turned into the draft of a book which we hope to serialise soon .\\nThe author of the blog , Sam Williams , and his collaborators have been working on their economic ideas for some decades .\\nThe creation of the Internet has allowed these ideas to be shared with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nMore recently , Williams has been responding to new developments and discussing with others who have engaged or critiqued his ideas .\\nI tried to critique his views on an aspect of economic theory I thought I had some familiarity with — productive and unproductive labour .\\nClassical economists like Adam Smith and David Ricardo along with Marx recognised that not all labour performed was productive of value and surplus value .\\nWe can see this easily when we look at the “ labour ” of a police officer , priest or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or factory worker .\\nI think we can identify who is a productive worker in that picture .\\nIt gets a more complicated when we look at the labour of bank workers and retail workers whose labour may or may not be necessary for production to occur .\\nIt gets even more complicated when we look at workers in health and education who may be employed in a private business producing a profit for the capitalist .\\nAnyway , that is the area I wanted to discuss .\\nSam was patient in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my first questions in a very pedagogical way .\\nThen when I wrote back still disagreeing , he wrote an even longer and more thorough response that included a reference to Albert Einstein , who , he said , proved that matter and energy are different forms of the same thing , just as physical goods and “ non-material ” services can both be commodities embodying labour value .\\nThat sealed the issue for me , and I conceded that they had a far better understanding of this issue .\\nWhat I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it appeared to answer many of the questions and doubts I had from my own reading of Marxist economic theory which has been an interest of mine though I am no “ expert ” , which I will come back to .\\nFrom a young age I had been very interested in Marxist economic theory .\\nInitially , I had been quite strongly influenced by a prominent Belgian Marxist economist by the name of Ernest Mandel .\\nMuch of what he wrote remains useful .\\nIn some things he wrote in the 1970s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the role of gold as the money commodity .\\nHe also played an important role in analysing the “ longwaves of capitalist development ” of 40- or 50-years ’ duration that appear to be a feature of capitalism , which I believe is correct .\\nThe Critique blog author also believes long waves play an important role and provides an explanation for a long cycle based on long-term swings in gold production , which makes the argument for its importance even more powerful .\\nAnother fine economist , Anwar Shaikh , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the history of capitalism involving long waves , has produced a graph that seems to support the Critique of Crisis theory on this point .\\nHe follows the long-term movement of wholesale prices in the US and the UK .\\nHe shows in his graph that there is a movement in wholesale prices upwards during a period of the long wave that is dominated by strong upturns in the business cycles and trend downward in prices during a period of the long wave where business cycles are dominated by the downward phase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholesale prices is associated with a period of stagnation or long depression under capitalism .\\nSo , we have the 1873-1893 decline , the Great Depression of 1929-1939 , the Great Stagflation of 1967-1982 and a similar decline , which he argues indicates a new Great Depression , beginning in 2008 which he describes in a lecture as a “ very scary ” conclusion for his students at that time .\\nTo produce an accurate version of the graph , he needed to measure the prices in terms of gold because , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold standard , there has been a permanent inflation in paper money prices that hides the real movement of prices in gold terms .\\nThis fits very closely with the Critique of Crisis Theory blog ’ s view , even though Shaikh is broadly in the school that looks for the cause of crises in the tendency of the rate of profit to fall ( TROPF ) .\\nThe crisis theory blog brings the very useful empirical work by Shaikh into long waves and crisis theory together in a blog as follows : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cycles dominated by the boom phases , the general price level rises above the value of commodities .\\nThis causes the rate of profit in the gold ( money material ) producing industries—mining and refining—to become less profitable than most other branches of industrial production .\\nCapital therefore begins to flow out of gold production and refining .\\nAs the production of money material declines , the quantity of money grows at an increasingly slow rate relative to real capital—productive and commodity capital .\\nAs a result , credit increasingly replaces money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limits .\\nMoney becomes tight and interest rates rise .\\nThis situation , assuming capitalist production is retained , can only be resolved by a crash or a series of crises and associated depressions of greater than average intensity , duration , or both .\\nOne result of a crisis or series of crises of greater than usual violence or duration is a lowering of the general price level—measured in terms of the use value of gold bullion—once again to below the value of commodities .\\nThis makes gold production and refining industries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capital once again flows into gold mining and refining , causing the production of gold bullion to rise once again .\\nThe quantity of money then expands with low interest rates and “ easy money ” .\\nAs the process of liquidating the previous overproduction goes on , especially of those commodities that serve as means of production , the accumulation of ( real ) capital stagnates .\\nAs a result , for a period of time , money capital is accumulated at a faster rate than real capital .\\nBut once the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ productive capacity—is liquidated , a new “ sudden expansion of the market ” occurs leading to a series of industrial cycles dominated by the boom phases rather than the crisis or depression phases .\\nThis “ long cycle ” is built into the commodity foundation of capitalist production and is the inevitable result of the commodity form itself once it is fully developed .\\nBut this cycle is also affected by accidental events such as discoveries of rich new gold mines and technological improvements in gold mining or refining that can either weaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as by such “ accidents ” as wars and revolutions .\\nSo , history is not an automatic repetition of cycles but a complex process involving both chance and necessity .\\nWilliams and his collaborators are quite orthodox in demanding a return to Marx on the nature of capitalist crises as crises of the general overproduction of commodities .\\nAt the same time they incorporate major developments of the capitalist system in the 150 years since Marx and Engels wrote to explain what is happening today .\\nThe Critique of Crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Marxist economic theory today .\\nThe blog is getting thousands of page views monthly and becoming influential in Marxist economic debates .\\nIt is getting the recognition and respect it deserves .\\nThe world reality we face today is conforming to the central theses of the blog .\\nThe current unfolding crisis and the 2007-9 crisis are both clearly global crises of overproduction .\\nThere were simply too many houses , too many cars , and so on .\\nOf course , “ too many ” from the point of view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold for a profit , not in terms of human need .\\nI think we all should pay respect to the founders of scientific socialism and give this issue of crisis theory the attention and importance it deserves .\\nWe can not leave it to others , to “ professionals ” or self-selected “ experts.\\n” I am not an “ expert ” on this stuff .\\nIt has been a continuing interest of mine because it is important that we understand what is happening and who we are , what our role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this system , who the agent of social change is going to be , and what the prospects are for making change in the world today .\\nThose are all issues that anyone who wants to find a way out of the permanent crises capitalism seems to have in store for us can begin to addr',\n",

       "  'content': 'The real economy is of course the supply of goods and services to satisfy peoples needs and some wants .\\nIn income tax , gains of capital are not taxable and gains of revenue are taxable .\\nThe distinction is very real e.g .\\ncapital is the farm , and the sale of the farm is not taxable , and revenue is the sale of the produce from the farm which is taxable .\\nAnd … anyway .\\nBecause we have things like the Pandora and Panama papers we can see that huge amounts of tax revenue are being lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealthy trying to turn revenue into capital as one of the ways to avoid tax .\\nEvery dollar of revenue turned to capital saves 28 % ( NZ tax rate for a company ) .\\nThis huge return on invested is gained by having a few clever accountants and lawyers to make sure you do it within the rules ; or arguably so .\\nWe all know this .\\nThis particular technique can be fixed relatively easily by simply removing for tax purposes the capital/revenue distinction for any non-individual entity .\\nAt this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find their hair , i.e .\\nit is not without impacts ; only one of them is paying tax .\\nIt is logical to remove this distinction because , unlike a natural person , everything a non-individual entity does is about protecting an economic asset or gaining money in some form ( capital or revenue ) .\\nSo everything a non-individual gains is truly revenue .\\nThis exposes the absurdity of treating a legal tool , a company or trust etc , as a ‘ person ’ for tax .\\nThis honour of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been savagely abused through tax avoidance .\\nThese entities are not simple extensions of people .\\nNothing remotely exists in a natural person like shareholding , — expanding and contracting the entity , extending and limiting share rights .\\nOr having limited liability ; as a person try telling that to your bank .\\nNote ; a ‘ natural person ’ would retain the capital/revenue distinction .\\nAnd this is all in the context of a company flat tax of 10 % with no deductions for expenses from traditional revenue .\\nThis generates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate of tax .\\nSo with no distinction between capital/revenue for a non-individual , capital gain becomes revenue and taxable .\\nThat means any assets sold by a company would become taxable revenue .\\nBut tax avoidance is so much more than this .\\nWe are forced to consider many items of capital that come into the company , are also revenue , such as some loans .\\n( Indoctrinated accountants may need a defibrillator at this point – Impossible !\\nCan ’ t work !\\nDestroy the economy ! )\\n.\\nWe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true arms length 3rd parties , i.e .\\nbased and registered in New Zealand to ensure our banking/finance market is stable and robust .\\nOverseas banks hold a risk of tax avoidance .\\nTo explain this a bit more .\\nE.g , A New Zealand company has a rental in Australia .\\nA management fee is paid and a loan is used to finance the rental ; reducing taxable income in Australia and the fees and interest are taxable income to who receives it .\\nBut if paid back to an entity in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The NZ rental owner rather than bringing taxable revenue back may send it back as a loan from the tax haven so it is not taxable here because loans are capital .\\nAnd in New Zealand interest for having that sneaky loan is deductible from New Zealand tax .\\nThis structure has to be hidden .\\nThen the New Zealand owner doesn ’ t mind paying a high interest rate , it ’ s tax deductible from our taxes .\\nThese loan can be written off which can create other tax opportunities .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ asset purchased may be used by the company in making goods and services .\\nIf we put 10 % on these assets that would increase costs and push up inflation .\\nSo an exemption would be needed so these purshase are not seen as income coming in , e.g.\\n, a non-individual importer of coffee gets beans from overseas .\\nThis asset coming into the company would not be subject to tax .\\nSo the production test would be that the asset is consumed in the supply of the goods or services .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ property to run a business from the premises this would be taxed in full on disposal , but should it be taxed on coming into the company ?\\nThe answer is ; yes .\\nBecause we don ’ t want our economic wealth diverted into holding of assets as the path to wealth creation , which is what is currently incentivised .\\nInvestment is needed into the production of goods and services .\\nSo the impact of taxing up front is that either individuals will make the purchases , ( a venture ?\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ their revenue ) .\\nOr the company will simply rent the premises .\\nOr go into a venture on development of the site to rent it .\\nWhatever way , taxation up front in addition to at the end , dissuades investment in capital assets and solidifies that the path to wealth is the supply of good and services to people and not the holding of assets which is currently destroying our economy .\\nIt does not stop the holding of assets but you will pay tax if you chose to .\\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital investments are longer term investments not flick on and off for quick profits .\\nSome other fixed assets that aid the delivery of the goods and services by business could be exempt , if they were tangible assets .\\ne.g .\\nTables , chairs in a restaurant .\\nBut all disposals will be subject to tax .\\nI ’ ve already said previously that to encourage employment in New Zealand ; salary and wages are deductible from revenue where we can track PAYE payments through Inland Revenue .\\nA call centre overseas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wages .\\nThen there are all the other assets , the shares in other companies , options , etc .\\nThese will be very hard to hide because companies need these in the financial accounts to attract investment and show how wealthy they are to stabilise loans .\\nConsequentially it will be very hard for companies to avoid tax for assets coming in or going out .\\nThe response will be firms will get bigger to minimise tax , so there are not inter company share swaps or transfers gettng caught by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will become more transparent and consequentially avoidance will be harder to undertake .\\nI have also written previously about share market impacts .\\nAnother outcome is losses are not allowed .\\nA salary and wage earner pays high tax one year in a good job ; changes job and goes to a low salary .\\nDid they over pay the previous year ?\\nNo , its irrelevant .\\nThey can ’ t spread tax over more than a year .\\nThe same should apply to non-individuals .\\nWe should only tax income and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual or non-individual .\\nBusiness is their risk .\\nLosses are not socialised onto taxpayers as that sets a bad market signal around taking risks .\\nWithout the allowance of expenses loses can ’ t occur .\\nOn removing capital/revenue distinction we will only tax gains , no losses allowed .\\nLosses demonstrate the priviledged status we give business over ordinary people .\\nLosses have encouraged tax avoidance practises which undermine our economy .\\nLosses are probably the main reason why Jacinda said no to capital gains taxes .\\nIt was all lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of a sharemarket fall generating huge capital losses which would wipe out all the revenue for government for a few years meaning massive borrowing to run the government .\\nAll lies because of the lack of imagination within the mandarins to imagine an economy different from the one they have been blindly indoctrinated into .\\nNew Zealand for sometime has been poorly served .\\nAsset based economies like we currently have are unstable and have repeatedly needed massive bailouts , e.g.\\n, 2008 and 2020 ; and Liz Truss in the UK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and our mandarins aren ’ t doing it .\\nThe current laws and policies are feeding an economy fixated on a path to wealth around the holding of capital assets .\\nTaxation and ownership laws are driving it .\\nIn response fringe insubstantial economic businesses have arisen based on immigration driving demand in the economy .\\nAnd education is a profit driven business with a focus on educating overseas people .\\nAre New Zealand ’ s economic interests actually being served ?\\nChange is relatively simple .\\nIt will be traumatic for larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up huge opportunities for smaller low cost businesses to arise as they will be more competitive .\\nIt does not take away the massive wealth that has already accumulated within large business , so they will have huge scope and financial resources to adapt .\\nBut here are the steps to getting our economy back onto the path of wealth creation through the supply of goods and services to ordinary people .\\nAnd these changes will completely change the current business incentive to angst about chocking off wages to hold inflation and moaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gleefully raise their prices .\\nNow they will have a huge incentive to ensure ordinary people are paid well enough to buy the goods and services that business need to sell in order to make money .\\nJust like Henry Ford paid his workers well so they could buy his cars and keep his factories going .\\nThe whole dynamic that currently drives inflation will change .\\nThese changes will help bring back an element of a Keynesian demand driven economy that works for the benefit of all classes like an economy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs and some of the wants of all people .',\n",

       "  'content': 'In an earlier post I detailed how the Labour government has embarked on the mass privatisation of state house land amid a housing catastrophe for people on low and middle incomes .\\nThe response to an Official Information Act request shows that in the last three years Labour has sold $ 131 million of former state house land – mostly through five LSPs ( Large Scale Projects ) being run by Kāinga Ora – listed in the table below .\\n( Land sales in a sixth LSP in East Porirua have not yet begun ! )\\nIn addition to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hundreds of millions more is in the pipeline to be sold .\\nAccording to Kāinga Ora the total land involved with these LSPs is 458 hectares with half this land projected to be sold to private property developers – all in prime locations which would be ideal for the large-scale state house building so desperately needed .\\nI pointed out the pattern being followed in each LSP is the same .\\nDemolish hundreds of state houses , sell most of the land to private property developers and use the proceeds to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small in terms of the numbers actually needed .\\nThis pattern began with the Helen Clark Labour government in the redevelopment of the Tamaki area of Auckland ( Glen Innes , Point England and Panmure ) , was continued by National under John Key and is being continued apace under the current Labour government .\\nIn addition to the land sales under the LSPs , Labour has sold former state house land elsewhere .\\nFor example in Mt Albert ’ s Asquith Avenue .\\nDon ’ t state house tenants want to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ s electorate ?\\nLand like Asquith Avenue is needed for the industrial-scale state house building programme which we urgently need .\\nWhen it comes to the sale of state houses themselves the current Labour government is continuing the practice of the former National government .\\nThe OIA response for state house sales from the last 10 years runs to 57 pages and thousands of state houses sold .\\nMost of these sales occurred under the previous National government including the infamous sale of all 1124 state houses in Tauranga to an offshoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been sold under Labour .\\nFor example National began the sale of state houses in Auckland ’ s Orakei suburb but Labour has been just as ruthless .\\nMeanwhile the mass sales of state houses has occurred under the current Labour government in places like Papakura ( over 100 homes for $ 68 million ) and New Plymouth ( 76 homes for $ 30.3 million ) The overall pattern being followed by successive Labour and National governments is the sale of state houses and former state house land in high and middle income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in lower income areas .\\nWhen confronted by the housing catastrophe for low and middle income tenants and families government spokespeople have created a smokescreen of bluff and bluster .\\nAs I pointed out earlier , despite the 25,000 on the state house waiting list ( up from 5,000 when Labour came to power in 2017 ) the government ’ s plan is to keep the total number of state houses at just 3.6 % of the total housing stock ( In 1990 it was 5.6 % ) and by selling crown land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government doesn ’ t have to put in a cent .\\nWhen Labour came to power in 2017 we had 63,315 state houses – as at June this year we have 69,509 .\\nAn average increase of just over 1200 per year for the 25,000 on the state house waiting list !\\nLabour cares as little as National about low and middle income citizens when it comes to housing .\\nAny claim to the contrary is simply untrue .',\n",

– Is Michael a neo liberal lunatic ?\\nI thought so ) .\\nBut when I look round for solutions all I find are neo liberal , ‘ it ’ s the money supply ’ rubbish .\\nLet ’ s look at it .\\nTo be clear , too much inflation is a very bad thing as it makes us poorer ; but not everyone .\\nWe know not everyone because of the large windfall profits large companies have made .\\nThe media inflation talk was its cost-push inflation from supply chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war .\\nBut if it was just cost push inflation then surely profits would go down as costs have risen .\\nBut no these firms also create inflation by raising prices in ‘ anticipation of inflation ’ rather than raise prices when their costs actually go up .\\nThis is a very good reason to promote and introduce a windfall profit tax .\\nThe fear of , or the introduction of such a tax should encourage firms to drop prices .\\nPerhaps they would be better off letting customers have lower prices rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arguments against what I just said ; those arguments are rubbish .\\nA bit of history .\\nThe Third Labour government to prevent this very problem of business driven inflation , introduced a ‘ maximum retail price scheme MRP ’ , e.g.\\n, a business bought say a large box of chocolate bars at a $ 1 a bar .\\nOil crisis 73/74 , and droughts around the world creating food shortages and prices went up .\\nFear of inflation was stoked .\\nSo the business instead of selling the bars as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reflect real costs , would charge $ 3 now in anticipation the next box of chocolates will cost more , say $ 1.75 a bar .\\nSo Labour made businesses put a price on a product at production , a maximum retail price , based on actual costs not expected costs ; to slow the growth of inflation .\\nBecause businesses were making a killing .\\nThe business argument was we have to raise prices now or we can ’ t afford to buy product/stock in future .\\nFunny how that argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to raise wages .\\nWorkers wage claims , after inflation has gone up , are said to drive inflation ?\\n?\\n?\\nNo , its only workers who have to tighten their belts and not get wage rises .\\nBusiness doesn ’ t have to reduce their profit expectations they are simply allowed to raise their prices as they see fit .\\nAnd as they see fit is to maximise profit ( and everyone else is doing it – aren ’ t they ) and their windfall profits show this is their thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future stock is bogus on economic grounds .\\nIf you have product sitting on your shelf and your worried about the cost in future .\\nTurn your stock over more quickly , so your next box is bought sooner without a large price rise i.e .\\ndrop your price to clear the product more quickly .\\nWhich would lower inflation .\\nThe MRP tag on the product is an especially good encouragement to do this .\\nI.e .\\na customer knowing lower prices can be on the shelf can encourage them to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dairy might have older stock with a lower price .\\nAnd large businesses don ’ t want that .\\nBut I don ’ t think we need to do MRP ; my point is just to show that we have recognised before that inflation is not just about money supply .\\n( National dropped MRP before it had any effect ) .\\nControlling inflation is not just about having to beat up ordinary salary and wages earners and their demands for food , accomodation and a bit of fun .\\nIt is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indoctrination to say interest rates are the only way to control inflation .\\nIt is overly simplistic to say the money supply is the cause of inflation .\\nSo stop drinking the Kool aid .\\nA key point of indoctrination is how we understand and talk about inflation .\\nIt is described as an impersonal aggregation of data , an outcome from forces like ; Demand-pull , Cost-push , wage rises , etc .\\nBut inflation is not just an impersonal aggregation of a huge amount of data .\\nInflation is a strongly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small group of autocrats ; it reduced oil production for political purposes .\\nTo keep oil prices high to help Russia pay for its fight in Ukraine .\\nAnd for Mohammed Bin Salman to undermine Joe Biden with inflation in the US midterms , so he could get a more favourable government in .\\nTrump was good for strategic interests .\\nAnd if you look back to the media as soon as Biden won , the political machine quickly kicked in , politicians McConnell , Cruz , right wing commentators , quickly raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whistle to businesses to raise prices in expectation of inflation .\\nAll to put inflation pressure on the Biden government in order to shut down economic policy changes that may help people , and create economic head winds to reduce Democrat chances of re-election .\\nAnd inflation allows firms to collect money from the government , using inflation to hoover up fiscal stimulas , even though their party is not in government .\\nSo there is often a relatively small number of events and decisions that create inflation .\\nAnd even the consequential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by small numbers of people ; executives in multi-national firms that dominate our economy .\\nThere is no huge impersonal mass aggregation of decisions , the individual consumer goods and service going up in price maybe a large aggregate , but not the decisions .\\nThere is no wisdom of the crowds/the market at work here .\\nInflation is a force in itself that can be used to maximise profit .\\nIf we are going to pull out wage—price spirals as a force that causes inflation then we have to include profit maximisation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some ignored communist in the old Soviet Union said this self evident truth .\\nSo poor Mr Orr , who can ’ t fix political decisions from overseas , running round yelling ‘ inflation ’ is the problem , is like yelling , ‘ Nobody did it ’ .\\nBut someone did do it .\\nAnd now we know who did it , we can find other tools to fix it .\\nThere is simply not enough pressure on the supply side not to raise prices .\\nTheir must be more pressure on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prevent a bad recession .\\nMr Orr raising interest rates is simply increasing costs , creating inflation , and he knows banks and businesses simply pass those costs on creating inflation .\\nAll the weight of the recession falls squarley but not fairly on the people , the demand side of the economy .\\nThe demand side of the economy is the lifeblood and the purpose of the economy , i.e .\\nto supply the needs and some of the wants of the people .\\nSo inflation is a real thing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the central problem in New Zealand with inflation is the pricing process , not the money supply .',\n",

and House Republicans that the 2020 Presidential Election was actually won by the incumbent ; then the idea that Labour is hellbent on trashing New Zealand ’ s unwritten constitution suddenly doesn ’ t sound crazy at all .\\nThe British Tories were tortured by the fear that remaining in the EU was tantamount to conceding that the days of global hegemony and imperial splendour were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the fear was remarkably similar : that their fate would be the same as the Brits ’ ; being edged off the world stage by larger emerging powers .\\nBrexit offered the opportunity to “ Take Back Control ” .\\nTrump promised to “ Make America Great Again ” .\\nBig ideas .\\nCrazy lies .\\nWhat idea is big enough to derange the Labour Party into courting electoral suicide ?\\nThe answer would appear to involve a radical revision of New Zealand history .\\nSomething along the lines of the colonisation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nIn this narrative , the colonial state is identified as the institution most responsible for the criminal dispossession of Aotearoa ’ s indigenous Māori population .\\nLabour ’ s big idea is to facilitate a revolutionary reconstitution of the New Zealand state .\\nNow , where would Labour get an idea like that ?\\nPutting to one side Labour ’ s Māori caucus , whose interest in such an historical project is entirely understandable , how could Labour ’ s Pakeha MPs have picked up such a self-destructive notion ?\\nWell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caucus ( which is to say nearly all of them ) are highly likely to have come across arguments for “ decolonisation ” at some point in their studies .\\nThe lawyers among them would certainly have encountered and absorbed “ the principles of the Treaty ” .\\nSo , too , would those coming to the Labour Party from the state sector .\\nIt would be interesting to know exactly how many members of Labour ’ s caucus have , at some point in their past , attended a “ Treaty Workshop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past 40 years these have become virtually compulsory for members of the professional and managerial middle-class .\\nThe version of New Zealand history conveyed to those attending these workshops is remarkably consistent : colonisers = baddies ; the heroic Māori who resisted the colonisers ’ ruthless predations = goodies .\\nOnly by giving full effect to te Tiriti o Waitangi can the wrongs of the past be righted : only then will equity and justice prevail .\\nMany of those attending Treaty workshops will have been invited to “ check their privilege ” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This can be a harrowing experience for many Pakeha , leaving them with a strong inclination to keep silent and step aside whenever those on the receiving end of “ white privilege ” are encouraged to step forward and speak out .\\nIn the most extreme cases , Pakeha are actively discouraged from sharing their opinions , lest their higher education and facility with the English language overawe and “ silence ” those denied such privileges .\\nWhen Labour ’ s Māori caucus ( the largest ever after the 2020 general election ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party ’ s absolute parliamentary majority to advance their Treaty-centric agenda , it is entirely possible they found themselves pushing on an open door .\\nIt is even possible that , formally or informally , the Labour caucus arrived at its own version of co-governance .\\nWhat the Māori caucus decided upon as its priorities were not to be overridden or gainsaid by the broader Labour caucus ’ s Pakeha majority .\\nAn arrangement of this sort would certainly explain how the Māori Health Authority and Three Waters became such immoveable items on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why the rising unpopularity of Nanaia Mahuta ’ s Three Waters project has , so far , proved unable to shift the Prime Minister and her Cabinet from their position of unwavering support .\\nLabour ’ s been here before .\\nIn the 1980s , the “ big idea ” that seized the imagination of most of the Labour caucus was what was then called “ free-market economics ” .\\nBy the end of the Fourth Labour Government ’ s second term it was clear that the consequences of the Rogernomics “ revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nDesperate to negotiate an economic policy U-turn , the Labour Party discovered that the Labour Government was , like Margaret Thatcher , “ not for turning ” .\\nIndeed , many MPs proudly declared that they would rather lose their seats than repudiate the economic reforms they had helped to introduce .\\nIn 1990 , Rogernomics was the hill Labour decided to die on .\\nAnd die it did – at least as a recognisably social-democratic party .\\nThe party ’ s left-wing departed with Jim Anderton to form NewLabour and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of neo- and social-liberals .\\nIt is , perhaps , unsurprising that Labour ’ s Māori caucus has found the party ’ s Pakeha majority so easy to cajole into backing what , from its perspective , is an entirely legitimate constitutional agenda .\\nLed by Nanaia Mahuta and Willie Jackson , the Māori caucus has taken full advantage of the fact that their Pakeha colleagues ’ lack of constitutional conviction has never been a match for their own passionate intensity .\\nThree Waters may be the hill Labour dies on , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle , the only corpses they ’ ll find will be Pakeha .\\nEach one clutching the “ Big Idea ” for which their party has paid the ultimate price .',\n",

       "  'content': 'The recent racism accusation by Ngozi Fulani in her home , England ; when being asked where her people were from is troubling .\\nThe words or situation by itself does not look racist but I can ’ t judge the situation as there is a whole lot of tone , and non-verbals that go into what the truth is .\\nBut I can speak of a situation I experienced that sounds almost exactly the same and I hope it will make people think and hopefully not be worried .\\nOn a Zoom call at work there was a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new to work very black young guy with an American accent .\\nHe was interesting because he was different .\\nI was interested in , what was his story , his experiences , just generally what he thought and moving here , why , what he hoped for ?\\nAs he was a little bit nervy , new , as I was interested in him as a person .\\nAnd a gap came up in the session I tried to engage him in talk .\\nI can ’ t recall the early first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very politely ‘ I was wondering where you came from ?\\n’ He reacted a little funny and said ‘ I ’ m a New Zealander ’ and I said being very polite and no aggression I ‘ no , I mean where ’ re from ’ .\\nHe reacted stiffly and largely non-verbally , and just very quickly shut down in terms of an answer and sort of said something like ‘ I ’ m here ’ .\\nI instantly recognised he was reading something into the situation that was nothing I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call moved onto a break into group session and then he didn ’ t come back into my group again , which was strange .\\nAnd I didn ’ t see him at the end of the session so I assume he asked not to come back to the group I was in .\\nSo , I can ’ t fix that .\\nI ’ m an old white bald guy so I can understand why young people wouldn ’ t want to talk to me that much .\\nBut a work environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private life is left at home .\\nYou bring your personality , flaws , warts , and strengths .\\nIt is okay for people to try to understand and engage with each other .\\nThis situation made me think of identity and another conversation where this young woman at work who simply described herself as Indian , made me really reflect on identity .\\nShe said New Zealanders were the only group of people she knew who described themselves in terms of fractions .\\nAnd that is exactly what I used to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irish , a quarter Scottish and a quarter Yugoslav .\\nThis was all based off my grandparents and it ’ s completely ridiculous .\\nGo back one generation and there was english !\\nAAARGGhh who wants that .\\nAnd of course go back only 70,000 years approx .\\nand we are all African .\\nI saw other people do this fraction thing to .\\nSo I assume it could be an immigrant culture where the ancestry gets partially lost .\\nSo identity links to some sort of knowledge of the past .\\nNot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspect in a lot of other people .\\nAnd how flexible identity can be .\\nI recall getting trees pruned at the back of a property and one of the guys who came was a very black guy .\\nLovely , polite , dignified .\\nI asked him where he was from and he said South Sudan .\\nI asked him about independence and the vote .\\nIt just blew me away that he thought they shouldn ’ t be independent .\\nAnd I asked why , he said there will be fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nIt seemed the devil you know .\\nSo South Sudan did not mean much to him or his identity .\\nAnd that he was here is another indicator of his understanding of identity .\\n( There was so much I wanted to ask but work stands in the way ) .\\nAnd how fragile identity can be on both sides .\\nIn regard to my work colleague , I was initially offended that he thought I was being racist .\\nFor a while I felt the racism or ageism was in him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old white guy must be being racist if he shows an interest in my background .\\nEven if his experience was that this was the case then projecting it onto me seems a racist or ageist assumption .\\nHe made no attempt to understand my intention .\\nBut his experience whether lived , or something he got out of a text book , is what you base life on , and acting on experience is not a bad thing .\\nSo why judge him harshly ?\\nSo I don ’ t .\\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference is one of the ways we give ourselves identity , i.e.\\n, we do this , or that .\\nWe protect identity by assuming it is good , valuable and worth having .\\nWell , not much point in having an identity and thinking it was bad .\\nWhy wouldn ’ t you change it then ?\\nAnd identity can therefore create conflict because it ’ s based on difference and belief in the goodness of the identity .\\nWe saw this in the Kaipara District Council and a Karakia before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a particularly religious person but my institution the church was relatively easy to leave as I don ’ t have to associate with it .\\nNot quite so easy being Maori and leaving the family community and the traditions you have left .\\nRace Relations Commissioner Meng Foon wasn ’ t that inspiring saying ‘ create the right space to encourage Maori to honour the Treaty of Waitangi , to provide a space to express their language and culture ’ ( TV1News ) .\\nIt sort of puts one side only as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed to also say secular society values of tolerance and community are represented by extending to Maori the right to express their traditions , and these traditions have a special place in our society through the Treaty .\\nAnd we all live in New Zealand as a Pacific nation , we are a people of the pacific .\\nPacific culture will have a special status because of these facts .\\nThere are things that I don ’ t like .\\nIn some marae women can ’ t speak .\\nOr women sit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ s none of my business .\\nI hope the younger Maori generation will be secure enough in their identity that they will push for change rather than just learning the tradition .\\nBut that ’ s easy for me to say .\\nSo I accept these things and I tolerate it because of the environments in which it happens .\\nSo experience has taught me that before I ask the question , ‘ where are you from ’ ; i ’ ll intro the question even more carefully .\\nBut I ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting and its fascinating hearing peoples stories .\\nAnd please , nobody should ever be put off from genuinely , in little bit and pieces , with give and take , asking questions about another persons background and , we shouldn ’ t assume the worst if they do .',\n",

and that is why we have a thin investment sharemarket .\\nAnd can ’ t our legal , lawful and democratically elected representatives make decisions on entrenchment around such significant issues as ownership of our natural resources for the benefit of our economy and all our people ?\\nAnd somehow that foundational to our society and democractic decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Law Society is favouring an ephemeral right to choice to sell over a real retention of a benefit to our society and economy .\\nThey were blinkered and did not look at the substance of what was being entrenched and the reality of who they were providing the choice to sell to , in a democratic society .\\nAnd of course quite rightly , we have civil rights , that protect the individual and constrain the majority from damaging the individual .\\nWe have courts that can constrain the majority .\\nThese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democratic ; but they constrain democracy so it is not an absolute .\\nDemocracy restrains democracy from being tyranny by the majority .\\nAnd the current risk to democracy is tyranny by the rich minority .\\nBut the Law Society were blinkered to that .\\nAnd the Law Society was further blinkered .\\nThey didn ’ t see the wood for the trees .\\nThe entrenchment cat has been out of the bag for sometime .\\nIt is easy to predict that National will introduce some entrenchment legislation for politcal purposes in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability to collect union dues , or law and order 3 strikes could be with 75 % to change it .\\nThey just won ’ t introduce it under urgency in the SOP stage .\\nLabour backing down does nothing to stop it coming up in future .\\nThe fundamental problem the Law Society missed is that the real debate is not entrenchment but the desperate need to have a written constitution to secure civil rights and prevent tyrannies .\\nTyrannies like ; political parties campaigning on one set of policies and getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something completely different .\\nOr small third parties holding democracy hostage to their whims , or pulling politics into extremist positions .\\nOr government being paralysed by a lack of consensus .\\nOr tyranny by the rich .\\nEntrenchment is a sideshow with the Law Society prancing around in it taking a political side .\\nAnd in our adversarial court system we know lawyers as a whole are only right about half the time .\\nThey got it badly wrong this time .\\nI don ’ t want these clowns involved in developing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gods sake Labour if you can ’ t grow cojones on entrenchment at least do it on a written constitution .',\n",

       "  'content': 'Constitutions are dynamic as they need to adapt to deal with the major problems of the day .\\nThat is their purpose ; to create rules to help run a democratic society according to our values .\\nIn my previous article I suggested the following problems were things a constitution could help our democracy deal with : • None political parties campaigning on one set of policies , then getting in and acting like dictators by doing something completely different .\\n• None small third parties holding democracy hostage to their whims , or pulling politics into extremist positions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back by small parties and look where we are now ) .\\n• None government being paralysed by a lack of consensus .\\nBut among the comments it was said a constitution can ’ t deliver the things I have suggested , i.e.\\n, a written constitution simply does not do these things .\\nAnd this is a problem a written constitution will face ; an indoctrinated pre-conception that a written constitution is largely about following the pattern of 18th century constitutions , i.e.\\n, a timeless classical and enduring form is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can do the things I suggest , let ’ s look at one of the prime examples , the US constitution .\\nAt the time of the formation of the US the main example for democracy was classical Greece .\\nNot a lot of help .\\n* But many of the wealthy participants in the conference to create the US constitution were terrified by the idea of the illiterate masses getting hold of the government and start doing things .\\nSo they made the President like a king , the Senate like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parliament .\\nSo all the work of Congress could be carefully controlled and supervised by the wealthy elites .\\nThe president of course was not elected by the people but by the electors .\\nThe US was barely a democracy as we understand one today .\\nAnd it ’ s democracy and economy still suffers today from that poorly designed framework which holds back the betterment of its people and the growth of its economy .\\nBut they did design the constitution to deal with the problems as they saw it in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had were from a time , over 200 years ago , when the whole concept of the role of government was tiny to what the government is tasked and capable of dealing with today .\\nJames Madison one of the founders of that US constitution did not see a constituion as a permanent structure but said the constitution should be changed on a regular basis .\\nI.e .\\na constitution has to adapt to the issues it faces on how to run a democracy .\\nOf course kings and dictators don ’ t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules to stop these outcomes arising .\\nThe reality of a constitution having to deal with modern democratic problems is most clearly seen in the terrifying example of the state of Israel .\\nLike us it has a proportional representation system but with a multitude of small parties .\\nBut the chances of a moderate centrist government as they had under Yitzhak Rabin has been squeezed out by the rise of extremism .\\nTo form governments centrists have to pander to extremist parties ; they can ’ t call them out or take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nAnd when I say extremist , a few of these parties believe in the end times and bringing about the end of world ; and what some say about Palestinians is deplorable .\\nDemocracy in the state of Israel is becoming a stain on the credibility of democracy as a form of government .\\nNew Zealand already has an example of how a constitution could shape the functioning of parliament .\\nMr Peters had an idea of creating a superannuation fund but the agreement was he had to take it out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the votes .\\nThis could be used to prevent small party policies dominating the large parties policies , i.e.\\n, they must be able to demonstrate their policies to the nation and not rely on smoke and whiskey fuelled back room deals .\\n( Referendums must be properly funded to fairly demonstrate the pros and con , and with some money to promote ) .\\nAnd to prevent a major party presenting it as their own rather than the small party it would have had to have been in the main parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example of a tiny idea about how we can use rules in a constitution to shape our democracy so the tail does not wag the dog .\\nThe idea of basing a written constitution on a static 18th century concept is not helpful .\\nA constitution could be reviewed every 10 or 20 years by public submissions and a panel from our best active academics with perhaps a few from overseas to give balance to hopefully make it less at risk of local politics ?\\nBring on the debate the crisis is already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Everything ’ by David Graeber and David Wengrow has fascinating insights on how early interaction with North American Indian societies helped shape Enlightenment thinking on freedom and society .\\nAnd ultimately that impacted democracy .\\np.s .\\nTo the jerk who suggested I ’ m the no1 wannabe lawyer in NZ .\\nI do know and have heard of many great and principled lawyers but there ’ s just too many scumbag lawyers for me to desire that moniker .\\nAnd we live in a democracy ;

       "  'content': 'LOOKING BACK over the five years this government has been in office , it ’ s hard not to feel depressed .\\nGiven the mess the Baby Boomers made of New Zealand between 1984 and 1990 , it was assumed that the first Generation X government would , at least , know what to do .\\nHaving learned their trade at the feet of Helen Clark and Michael Cullen , Jacinda Ardern , Grant Robertson and Chris Hipkins should have been immune to the allure of grand ideological schemes ; and known better than to make promises they couldn ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over-deliver.\\n” That was Helen Clark ’ s mantra for the 15 years she led ( that is to say utterly dominated ) the Labour Party .\\nIn a nation still enthralled to neoliberalism , the formula made perfect sense .\\nFull-on social-democracy , as the Third Labour Government discovered , was verboten – even in the hey-day of Keynesianism .\\nThatcher and Reagan made social-democracy even harder .\\nIn its essence , Rogernomics represented Labour ’ s complete capitulation to the new economic and political order .\\nHenceforth , the best social-democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programmes which , while mostly making life easier for capitalists , occassionally scattered a few crumbs in the direction of the poor .\\nBy under-promising and over-delivering , a Labour government could present itself as both sensible and competent .\\nNot much might be on offer , but if you said you were going to deliver – and you did – then your voters weren ’ t just grateful , they were impressed .\\nThe days of big dreams might be over , but Clark ’ s clear-headed grasp of her own and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it possible for some of the people ’ s smaller dreams to come true .\\nWhat was it that persuaded Jacinda Ardern to exactly reverse Helen Clark ’ s strategy ?\\nEven with the winds of history at your back , over-promising the electorate is a silly thing to do .\\nNo government should ever attempt to defy Murphy ’ s Law , especially in circumstances where its supposed servants feel morally obliged to wreck any attempt to change the status-quo .\\nIf anything can go wrong with an unorthodox left-wing government ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are going to make damn sure that it will .\\nIt is astonishing that Ardern , Robertson and Hipkins never appreciated how many of the Fifth Labour Government ’ s achievements required only a modest reconfiguration of already existing administrative machinery .\\nClark and Cullen avoided , wherever possible , projects that required a major reshaping of the physical world .\\nThey would never have been so foolhardy as to promise the construction of 100,000 “ affordable ” houses .\\nWho was going to build them ?\\nMore to the point , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neoliberalism had shut down the active state , it wasn ’ t about to start it up again .\\nAnd yet , Ardern and Robertson did nothing but raise expectations .\\nNew Zealand was going to be “ transformed ” .\\nKindness and wellbeing were going to replace neoliberalism ’ s watchwords of “ effectiveness ” and “ efficiency ” .\\nPoverty , itself , was in the Prime Minister ’ s cross-hairs .\\nAfter 30 years of the dismal science ’ s overcast skies , the sun was poised to break through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful day !\\nLabour ’ s whole front-bench seemed to be on Ecstasy .\\nBut just as Labour ’ s big promises were on the point of being revealed as hollow , effectively scuppering the Government ’ s chances of re-election , big events intervened to restore its fortunes .\\nIt is hard to come up with a better example of ill winds blowing a floundering government so much good .\\nCertainly , Ardern ’ s response to the Christchurch Terror Attacks , and then to the Covid-19 Pandemic , drove Labour ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Government ’ s performance was aided immeasurably by the neoliberal playbook being uncharacteristically thin on how to deal with terrorist horrors and killer viruses .\\nIn extremis , Ardern and her advisers fell back on ideas and responses inimical to the radical individualism of the neoliberal ideology .\\nPeople were suddenly introduced to the spiritual and material benefits of collectivism and solidarity .\\n“ They are Us ” proved mightier than the Aussie gunman ’ s semi-automatic .\\nIt felt good to be part of a team of five million .\\nArdern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleagues holding on for dear life behind them , rode these mighty exogenous tidal-waves all the way to an absolute parliamentary majority – which turned out to be just about the worst thing that could have happened to them .\\nAbsent Winston Peters and his white-knuckle grip on the political hand-brake , Labour lost little time in showing the country just how important NZ First ’ s restraining influence had been .\\nOver the next two years , convinced they were ten-feet-tall and bulletproof , Ardern ’ s government proved itself unsafe at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labour ’ s political delinquency was its conviction that the events of 2019 and 2020 had conferred upon the party ’ s leadership an unchallengeable moral authority .\\nThat the groups it was marginalising and ( in their own eyes ) persecuting : conservative Pakeha males ; the militantly unvaccinated ; traditional feminists ; fundamentalist Christians ; believers in freedom of expression ; supporters of the National and Act parties ; homeowning Baby Boomers ; just might , together , add up to a majority of the electorate , did not slow them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these deplorables to acknowledge the Government ’ s moral superiority made its members very angry .\\nLabour found the anti-vaxxer occupation of Parliament Grounds in February-March 2022 especially confronting .\\nThe naked hatred and contempt directed at them by some of the protesters left many parliamentarians convinced that such people needed to be silenced .\\nThe defenders of free speech were allowing crazed conspiracy theorists and the spreaders of misinformation and disinformation to poison the public wells .\\nA line needed to be drawn .\\nMore rational , but equally problematic , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take advantage of the party ’ s parliamentary majority to quicken the pace of decolonisation and indigenisation .\\nThis was necessary , they told their Pakeha colleagues , if the party was serious about forging a credible partnership between Māori and the Crown .\\nUnwilling to risk accusations of racism , most of Labour ’ s caucus acquiesced .\\nAny misgivings they may have harboured about co-governance , Three Waters , He Puapua and the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples , remained unacknowledged and unvoiced .\\nOnly Labour ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers the slightest hope that the almost manic quality of its parliamentarians ’ behaviour might be recognised for what it so clearly is : electorally suicidal .\\nIf not , then Roger Hall ’ s description of the Labour Party in his 1977 stage play , Middle Age Spread , may yet be applied to the bizarre mixture of febrility and fortitude that characterised Jacinda Ardern ’ s manic ministry : “ Honestly the Labour Party remind me of a documentary I saw on television about sleeping sickness .\\nAll these people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years were given this new wonder drug and they all came alive and sang and danced around for a bit … and then the drug wore off and Zap !\\nBack to sleep for another twenty years .\\n”',\n",

down the gauntlet on drug reform ” .\\nThere was more at the NZ Herald and Newshub .\\nRNZ looked at how a US President set NZ ’ s drug laws , with Guyon Espiner writing : When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the War on Drugs began , pardons thousands of people for the crime of possessing marijuana you can smell that change is in the air .\\nWhen the Economist , a sober , rigorous adherent to economic liberalism , says that Joe Biden is being too timid and it ’ s time to legalise cocaine , you get a sense of how far-reaching that change might be .\\nWhen you consider New Zealand , which sees itself as a socially liberal democracy , still maintains a prohibition on cannabis and locks people up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how far we are falling behind .\\nIn breaking news this week , the Medicines Classification Committee has recommended no change to the status of CBD , the non-psychoactive cannabis derivative used by thousands of Kiwis to help with conditions such as inflammation , epilepsy , pain , anxiety

necessary to harmonise with Australia ’ s scheduling of low-dose CBD.\\n” The committee recommended the classification of low-dose CBD remain unchanged .\\nAustralia ’ s Cannabiz website is the only

       "  'content': 'It ’ s a rhetorical question I know but further confirmation these parasitical life forms are as bad as we always knew came this week .\\nIn December 2021 , under former mayor Lianne Dalziel , Christchurch City Council commissioned a report on the performance of Christchurch City Holdings Limited ( CCHL ) which holds and manages the council ’ s shares in Christchurch Airport , the Lyttelton Port Company , Enable fibre broadband company and the city ’ s service maintenance company City Care .\\nAnd who did they ask to do the review ?\\nInvestment bankers of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( see the PS at the end of this blog for an earlier example ) And what did Northington Partners say ?\\nThe council should sell its assets – at least up to 49 % .\\nA bogus projected 70 % increase in rates over the next 10 years was used as a shock/horror figure to create fear and panic to drive asset sales .\\nIt ’ s a simple Business-Roundtable-textbook approach , the same approach being used by new Auckland Mayor Wayne Brown for asset sales there .\\nNeedless to say none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asset sales before the election – knowing how deeply unpopular they are with the public .\\nBut as soon as their feet are under the table they are like kids with a dollar coin burning a hole in their pocket .\\nThey can ’ t wait to privatise so the wealthiest New Zealanders can have access to the lucrative dividends from these monopoly blue-chip companies – at the expense of the rest of us .\\nThe so-called “ independent review ” by Northington Partners is anything but .\\nIt is speaking on behalf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been trying to “ deepen Aotearoa New Zealand ’ s capital markets ” through the privatisation of government and local body assets .\\nIt is Northington Partners corporate clients who would be the beneficiaries of council asset sales .\\nIncluded in their report , and confirmation they have never done an honest day ’ s work in their lives , Northington Partners blames the “ highly unionised workforce ” for claimed underperformance of the Lyttelton Port Company .\\nThe joint media release from the Maritime Union of New Zealand and Rail and Maritime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shallow and nasty the NP report is : Joint media release Maritime Union of New Zealand – Rail and Maritime Transport Union FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Friday 9 December 2022 Workers at Ports of Lyttelton have strongly rejected an attack on their work in a privatisation report to the Christchurch City Council .\\nLPC workers are members of the Maritime Union of New Zealand ( MUNZ ) and the Rail and Maritime Transport Union ( RMTU ) .\\nA report on Christchurch City Holdings Limited and its companies compiled by Northington Partners was released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is underperforming – and suggests this is due to a “ highly unionised workforce.\\n” Maritime Union of New Zealand National Secretary Craig Harrison says there are around six hundred port workers in Lyttelton who deliver to the people of Christchurch and Canterbury , the majority being LPC employees .\\nDespite the report stating productivity issues are ‘ outside scope ’ and were ‘ not analysed ’ , it offers a view based on ‘ initial observations and stakeholder feedback.\\n’ No sources for these observations or feedback are provided .\\nMr Harrison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reference to the Port of Tauranga as a preferred employment model shows an absolute lack of understanding of serious problems in the ports industry .\\nMr Harrison says the outsourcing employment model at Port of Tauranga has had very poor outcomes for workers .\\n“ One of the worst impacts has been employees of contracting stevedores having unhealthy and dangerous shift patterns , which has disrupted family life , health and safety.\\n” “ The implied support in the report for contracting out labour – obviously to reduce wages and conditions – @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CCHL organizations must abide by.\\n” Mr Harrison says these contracting out issues have been widely covered in the media and recognised nationally in 2022 in two ways .\\nA recent Employment Court decision requires a large private stevedore in Tauranga to change its operations to acknowledge workers ‘ availability ’ to protect their work/life balance and right to family life .\\nIn addition , the national ports industry has just announced national ports health and safety guidelines which focus on the impact of fatigue due to shift work .\\nRail and Maritime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is unimpressed with the logic used the report which is clearly a roadmap for privatisation .\\n“ We need to maintain our local assets and defend them against the privatisation agenda.\\n” Mr Valster says the report makes an error in trying to draw simplistic comparisons between Lyttelton and other ports like Tauranga , when size and many other variables influence outcomes .\\n“ It is dangerous when people without a deep knowledge of the ports industry start setting themselves up as experts in port productivity.\\n” Mr Valster says the primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether it is serving its purpose as key infrastructure .\\n“ The benefits LPC provides as a reliable import/export hub for

the scorn it deserves .\\nPS : Lianne Dalziel had taken the same approach earlier in her mayoralty when she asked notorious privatisers Cameron Partners to go over the city finances and produce a report on the basis of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million in capital ” – in other words to sell assets – to avoid what was claimed as a future billion-dollar budget blowout .\\nThe figures were bogus of

       "  'content': 'THE QUESTION dividing Kaipara ’ s electors , and the rest of New Zealand , is one of political legitimacy and cultural power .\\nWhose protocols should prevail : the standing orders of the local council ; or , the tikanga of the local iwi ?\\nIn strictly legal terms , the standing orders of the Kaipara District Council , as interpreted by the elected head of the council – Mayor Craig Jepson – must prevail .\\nThe order of business , and the manner in which that business is conducted , is for him – and for him alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rolling maul that is New Zealand ’ s racial politics , the letter of the law no longer counts for very much .\\nAs events in Kaipara have proved , it ’ s all about who can mobilise the most outrage – especially in the news media and online .\\nOn that score , the woman at the centre of the controversy , the woman representing the Te Moananui o Kaipara Māori Ward , Pera Paniora , is well ahead on points .\\nAt the heart of the controversy lies Ms Paniora @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting of the newly-elected Kaipara District Council with a karakia , or prayer .\\nAccording to standing orders , it is the Mayor who has the responsibility for opening the Council ’ s inaugural meeting .\\nThis he was attempting to do when Ms Paniora interrupted the proceedings with a request to recite a karakia , and upon being refused permission , protested , and had to be brought to order by the Mayor .\\nMs Paniora justified her interruption of the proceedings by claiming that the Mayor was acting in defiance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayor Jepson responded by taking a firm stand on the secular character of political authority in New Zealand – a doctrine derived from the liberal-democratic insistence upon the separation of Church and State : “ This is a council that ’ s full of people who are non-religious , religious , of different ethnicities and I intend to run a secular council here which respects everybody and I will not be veering from that.\\n” Given that New Zealand is one of the most secular nations on earth , with fewer than half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayor would appear to be on solid ground .\\nRather than privilege one councillor ’ s religion over everybody else ’ s , his solution , to have no prayers at all , struck many New Zealanders as eminently sensible .\\nIn the ears of many Māori , however , Mayor Jepson ’ s words struck an unmistakably “ racist ” note .\\nIn their estimation , it is not for Pakeha , no matter what political office they may hold , to prevent a young Māori woman from upholding tikanga by initiating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ karakia seeking God ’ s blessing upon the proceedings .\\nJepson ’ s actions kindled an angry response from Māori ( and not a few Pakeha ) across the country .\\nWho did he think he was ?\\nWell , he probably thought he was the legally recognised leader of the Kaipara community .\\nThe 4,228 votes he received from the electors of the Kaipara District , representing 50.5 percent of the 8,366 votes cast , earned him the title , status , and powers of Mayor .\\nOnce , that title would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media , but – no more .\\nThe mainstream news media remained steadfastly silent on the subject of Mayor Jepson ’ s political legitimacy , and his legal authority as Chair of the Council .\\nIt similarly refused to address the question posed by the Mayor concerning of the appropriateness , or otherwise , of injecting religion into what are generally understood to be secular proceedings .\\nAll that seemed to matter was that he had silenced a young Māori ward councillor at her first meeting – an action which most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was racist in both intent and effect .\\nFew , if any , reporters raised the question of who carried the most democratic weight in this

impressive as Mayor Jepson ’ s 50.5 percent .\\nAlso unremarked upon was the fact that just 246 votes were required to make Ms Paniora a Councillor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required to make Mr Jepson a Mayor .\\nOr that the General Roll turnout in Kaipara District was 50.4 percent , compared to the Maori Roll turnout of 29.4 percent .\\nThat none of these numbers were taken all that seriously is attributable to the widely held view among Māori , and some Pakeha , that New Zealand ’ s liberal-democratic system is a relic of colonisation , rendering it both oppressive and morally repugnant .\\nAccordingly , in the mainstream news media ’ s reporting of the Kaipara controversy the political weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost entirely , by their ethnicity .\\nThat Māori have taken offence at the behaviour of a Pakeha politician is deemed to be resolvable only by the latter ’ s more-or-less total capitulation to the former .\\nThat Mayor Jepson has announced a compromise solution to the

prayer , or incantation of their own choosing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too late .\\nIn matters of this sort only the most complete abasement before the tikanga of the mana whenua ( local wielders of power )

Ms Paniora ’ s bid to recite a karakia in the opening seconds of the newly-elected council ’ s first meeting constituted a test to see whose ways would prevail in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inheritors of the Anglosphere ’ s liberal-democratic system of government , with its historical suspicion of social hierarchies and religious sentiments , and its secular faith in the egalitarian rules of orderly deliberation ?\\nOr , the ways of Te Ao Māori : imbued with spirituality , guided by tikanga , and executed by those with the mana to both convince , and to command ?\\nIt is difficult not to sympathise with Mayor Jepson , to whose aid and comfort so few people have sprung .\\nWhere were the electors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks ago , thought this man Jepson worthy of their support ?\\nIs there really no one in the North willing to stand up for liberal-democracy ?\\nCertainly , the comparison with the hundreds of local Māori who were willing to come out yesterday ( 14/12/22 ) in support of their representative is a telling one .\\nThe game is far from over , but at the moment the score is definitely : Paniora 1 , Jepson Nil .',\n",

which is just about people buying things to satisfy their basic needs , and some of their wants .\\nIf people are mortgaged up to the hilt , i.e.\\n, to get basic shelter , that is not an indication of their poor decision making but a reflection of the neo liberal market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it can and then sells as expensively as it can to maximise profit .\\nThis is enhanced and facilitated by those willing to make massive loans to these people/buyers in order to maximise their own company profits .\\nThe neo-liberal market economy creates self serving corporate monsters who work against people ( too many people struggling to pay groceries , mortgages and rents , monsters lacking flexibility for adapting the economy for climate change , or to look after water , etc ) .\\nAnd the Greens under David Shaw have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; well they gave up the fight years ago .\\nWorking alongside neo-liberal monsters could never work .\\nJust take the electric car subsidy , business just jack up their prices to take the subsidy .\\nLabour ’ s first budget with the extra $ 50 for the accomodation allowance ; rents simply went up to absorb it .\\nThey mocked Labour/Green naivety .\\nWorking for families is a subsidy to help employers pay low wages , and yet business grumble about it .\\nIf government fiscally tries to spend to help people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it because there is ‘ demand in the economy ’ .\\nIf the government talks of raising taxes then businesses threaten to raise prices to keep their profits the same .\\nIt ’ s all gim me gim me for business in a neo-liberal economy .\\nThere is no self regulation or natural brake on pricing in the structure of the neo-liberal economy .\\nBut there is !\\nSay neo-liberals !\\nReduced demand .\\nBut wealth in our neo liberal economy is no longer dependant on providing goods and services , so demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring down prices .\\nBusiness now wait till government stumps up money to help people pay their higher prices .\\nAll while they shift wealth to shares and other capital assets .\\nAnd crazier ; business don ’ t feel wealthy because they followed ‘ good ’ accounting advice and are all heavily debt financed , so they need high share prices to sustain those loans .\\nThe CEO incentive is to keep share prices high .\\nAnd neo-liberal goverments since the 1980s have encouraged this as if it is a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole economy under neo-liberalism is a house of cards , propped up by government largesse when they try and support people .\\nThe pricing process is broken and is being abused to maximise profit .\\nBut it wasn ’ t always like this .\\nIn the US , e.g.\\n, Henry Ford paid high wages so that workers could afford to buy his car .\\nBut he also drove production costs down and tried to sell his car cheap to encourage purcahses .\\nIt was about turnover to maximise profit .\\nThe way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or service to people .\\nBut now the path to wealth is about holding a capital asset , e.g.\\n, a house , or shares .\\nIt is about marketing and how to extract ‘ consumer surplus ’ , to maximise each point of sale .\\nHow to deceive and manipulate customers to spend .\\nThe focus is not on driving down costs .\\nIn fact some costs are tax positives ; depreciation , interest payments .\\nIn the 50 and 60 ’ s we had a roaring economy based around supplying goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not a big problem .\\nSuddenly now it always causes inflation .\\nWhy ?\\nThe existence of government services acted as a brake on overpricing .\\nGovernment had e.g .\\ninsurance , bank , power companies , post office , a ministry of works , an effective rail service and interislander .\\nAll these government agencies were slow to raise prices and therefore kept a check on private business ability to raise prices or they would be priced out of the market .\\nThat was a more effective competition .\\nAnd with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) were taken care of at a relatively low cost , supported by higher taxes , it left more discretionary income to stimulate the rest of the economy .\\nBut now , perversely , competition is often inhibited .\\nGovernment agencies SOE ’ s work to maximise profit .\\nFor example The Interislander doesn ’ t compete with the alternative .\\nIt could compete and crush it like private enterprise is supposed to do , but its more profitable with a struggling or weaker competitor to use them to help keep your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go .\\nYes new firms may want to come in but they still want to keep the prices high to maximise profits .\\nWe see this problem in housing , in mobile phones , everywhere .\\nIt ’ s easier to raise prices to gain profit rather than gain market share .\\nTo wheedle and fiddle pricing while consumers are distracted living their own lives .\\nThe whole efficiency theory of the market is bumkin .\\nSo a windfall tax doesn ’ t stop inflation it just taxes the outcome of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to not pay the tax by keeping prices lower .\\nBut we did previously have some natural checks on pricing and inflation : • None when the economy had a path to wealth based on supplying goods and services to people .\\n( I ’ .e if you raise prices you lower demand and then you can find your business out of market share ) .\\n• None we had lots of essential services supplied by government at lower costs than private enterprise could ( recall — that is why New Zealand had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private enterprise in the early days of New Zealand was failing .\\nAnd here we are again with private enterprise failing ) .\\nWe can help achieve the first bullet above by reforming our tax and ownership laws , and this action will help fight inflation .\\nThe three key reforms are : • None Remove the deductibility of expenses for non-individuals ( this is already the case for salary and wage earners ) .\\nSo all existing gross income is taxed at least at 10 % ( on current date it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 28 % on net income ) .\\nThis traditional ‘ income ’ is only taxed once .\\nDeductibility for salary and wages paid through the Inland Revenue PAYE system would remain so their is no discouragement to employing people .\\n• None Removing expense deductibility reduces wasteful spending and tax avoidance opportunities .\\nHigh cost industries like mining and oil exploration will bear their full cost and if this is prohibitive then that reflects the real cost of the busiess .\\nA shift to focus on recycling is certain .\\nEnvironmental protections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destructive practises are not allowed .\\n• None Remove for tax the capital/revenue distinction for non-individuals .\\nThis means all that is gained from disposal of a capital asset is subject to tax at 10 % .\\nAnd all assets that come into the firm are subject to tax at 10 % including loans .\\n( except if the loan is a true third party loan from a New Zealand based , approved and registered entity , i.e.\\n, a NZ bank ) .\\nYes a business can still borrow from overseas but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much tax avoidance happens to covert income into capital ; like loans .\\nAnd there would be an exception from this tax for goods fully consumed in the production of a good or service .\\nNote : this is not a capital gains tax but a redefinition of what ‘ income ’ is .\\nAssets should be relatively easy to track as companies want to celebrate and sell themselves through their financial accounts .\\nIf gains are not here that is likely to be evasion .\\n• None Removing this distinction cuts off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wealth creation , the holding of capital assets .\\nTherefore fixing the fundamental flaw in our economy .\\nAnd taxing assets both into and out of an entitiy is a significant disincentive to hold capital assets as a proxy income .\\nThis forces the path to wealth creation back to the supply of goods and services to ordinary people as the path to wealth .\\nAnd that will help put more of a natural restraint on inflation .\\n• None Limit the ownership laws so you must go back to a natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This will simply change the way companies are organised .\\nThey will become bigger , more visible , and should be more transparent , and therefore more accountable .\\nThese changes can transform the New Zealand economy relatively easily without agreement from overseas trade organisations or countries .\\nIt would be traumatic for some , the neo-liberal nutcases who have damaged and poisoned our economy .\\nBut a huge number of business opportunities will open up outside the currently favoured high cost business structures with overseas ownership .\\nThe neo-liberalism approach to economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collapse with each bust .\\nIt ’ s exploitation of the envionrment is unsustainable .\\nWe have to do something sooner rather than later and these changes strike at the heart of the problems , like inflation .\\nThese changes are not extreme .\\nThey are neither left or right wing , they just help put the correct incentives back into the economic forces that our economy and society rely upon .\\np.s .\\nWe can eliminate GST .\\nIt ’ s regressive and it suppresses demand which is critical to the economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflationary effects of these changes .\\nOther changes are possible .',\n",

       "  'content': 'Kaipara Mayor Craig Jepson ’ s refusal to allow a karakia to be said at the beginning of his first council meeting is not the great “ struggle for political legitimacy and cultural power ” that Chris Trotter suggests .\\nIt is a simple story of lack of cultural respect , and possibly ignorance , by the mayor .\\nMost of the criticism he has received is well deserved and to suggest the disapproval heaped on him is a challenge to the mayor ’ s political legitimacy is just plain silly .\\nThe mayor has a right to his opinions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chris Trotter to suggest he has some kind of democratic mandate to deny a karakia at the start of a council meeting .\\nHad the mayor raised this as an issue during the election campaign he ’ d be on stronger ground but as far as I ’ m aware his decision to refuse what is a widespread , respectful , cultural practice in meetings across our public services and public institutions came out of the blue to Kaipara voters .\\nIf Craig Jepson thought democracy was the issue he could have put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council table but chose not to do that either – he doesn ’ t have a claim of political legitimacy for his decision or a democratic leg to stand on .\\nMayors are not elected to dictate and their most important role is to provide positive leadership in bringing their diverse councillors and communities together to work on the full range of local body issues .\\nWhat is astonishing is that he seemed unaware that refusing karakia at the start of the meeting , something which is becoming a well-established kiwi cultural practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where has he been the last 40 years ?\\nI may be wrong but I suspect his denial of Māori cultural input at the meeting is rooted in deeper antipathies which will be shared by others in the area , hopefully a minority .\\nBut it is not his role to parade his prejudices after the election and leave voters , in particular mana whenua , angry and bewildered .\\nThe best one could say about Mayor Jepson is that he was misguided and clumsy – but like all of us he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important to say here ( to the atheists at least , of which I am one ) that karakia may involve a Christian prayer , such as has been used to open parliament each sitting day , but in my experience are more often than not a simple , non-religious , expression of Māori cultural values .\\n( To learn the difference , learn Te Reo ) Either way their expression adds richness and depth to our public life in Aotearoa New Zealand and values the heritage of mana whenua .\\nKarakia before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect .\\nIt ’ s disturbing that Chris Trotter finds the heavy criticism of the mayor ’ s decision an expression of Māori “ cultural power ” as though this is a worrying , negative development .\\nEnhancing our democracy means respecting all cultures and in particular finding and opening up ways big and small for expressions of Māori self-assertion after the dominant European “ cultural power ” , through its long history of delegitimising , denigrating and attempting to erase Māori culture altogether ( destruction of a language is destruction of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devastation which continues to resonate for Māori today .\\nI don ’ t want to get on a high horse but it needs to be said that Europeans are still largely ignorant of the colonial history of Aotearoa and the impact on Māori .\\nThere are a lot of good books available at local libraries and I ’ d recommend “ The Great War for New Zealand ” by Vincent O ’ Malley if you want a good place to start .',\n",

)\\n.\\nWhile most media parroted their supposed role in encouraging high expectations from using CBD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes of perception or expectations .\\nThe meta-analysis of 20 previous studies concluded media attention was “ not associated with the clinical outcomes ” .\\nSome media coverage this week of what Marijuana Media had revealed last week : NZ ’ s Medicines Classification Committee has recommended no change for CBD .\\nThe committee rejected a proposal from Medsafe to harmonise with Australia , which is allowing over-the-counter sales of so-called “ low-dose ” Cannabidiol .\\nThese are packs containing up to 150mg per day to a maximum of 4500mg per pack ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approved in NZ ) .\\nNewsroom noted “ little to no recent research was considered ” .\\nOnly five submissions were received , including from myself , Rua Bioscience and the Pharmacy Guild .\\nThe committee dismissed the evidence from Australia ’ s TGA which found CBD had a remarkable safety profile and no serious adverse effects .\\nNow the Aussies are coming , with their Canadian weed .\\nMedReleaf NZ , a subsidiary of MedReleaf Australia , has been granted a Medicinal Cannabis Supply Licence from our Ministry of Health , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Canada ’ s Aurora .\\nAnother Aussie company , Releaf , says it intends to open cannabis doctor clinics in New Zealand soon .\\nThere are already at least 10 cannabis doctor clinics operating .\\nThey are easy to find by googling “ cannabis doctor nz ” or we have their details at The Hempstore .\\nThe New Zealand Herald profiled Christchurch-based PPE glove maker Eagle Protect last Monday , and revealed one of their biggest markets is the US legal cannabis industry .\\nThe company motto is “ It is hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are surrounded by turkeys.\\n” In hemp news , Stuff reports some of New Zealand ’ s oldest remaining woolsheds are a “ trip back in time ” , containing relics from New Zealand ’ s history including hemp bales among the weighing scales , hooks and stencils .\\nOn Radio NZ the founder of NZ ’ s largest ( and last ) clothing factory , Cactus Outdoor , wants to help rebuild the apparel eco system so our cops will wear hemp .\\nCactus manufactures uniforms for the police and military using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , “ I would love someone to start the fabric mills , so that New Zealand wool and hemp that ’ s grown here could actually be made into fabric here.\\n” They should check out NZ Yarn – it ’ s coming soon !\\nAlso on Stuff this week , their Summer Festival Guide recommends Twisted Frequency , Dec 30 to Jan 3 in Golden Bay , for its “ Big hemp energy all round ” .\\nSounds good !\\n· Pot prisoner Brittney Griner freed in prisoner swap ( extensive coverage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nStuff , 1News ) · Amsterdam launches ‘ Stay Away ’ campaign to discourage excessive tourism ( NZ Herald ) .\\nPossible new rules include banning cannabis sales on weekends and banning smoking on the street .\\nAmsterdam ’ s mayor , Femke Halsema , has already proposed banning tourists from buying cannabis products in coffee shops altogether .\\n· Cannabis legalisation took effect in Missouri .\\nNORML Chair Dan Viets noted most of the state ’ s 20,000 annual cannabis arrests will now stop .\\n“ Instead , adults will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ounces of cannabis , and soon will also have the option to grow up to 18 plants or purchase cannabis products tested for purity and potency from licensed retailers.\\n” · Connecticut ’ s governor announced their intent to wipe 40,000 cannabis convictions on the 1st of Jan 2023 .\\nSo far , 24 states have enacted legislation facilitating the expungement of marijuana-specific convictions , wiping the records of two million people according to analysis by NORML released this week .\\nTune in to bFM Drive ’ s Jonny and Chris Fowlie from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thursday at 4:20pm on 95bFM .\\nYou can stream or download the pot-cast for this and hundreds of other Marijuana Media shows at 95bFM.com ( or via iTunes / RSS feed ) .\\nLinks to all the stories we discuss are posted here at The Daily Blog .',\n",

       "  'content': 'ONE OF THE MOST DISTURBING ASPECTS of race-based politics is the difficulty many citizens have in taking racially-driven change seriously .\\nThis is particularly the case when the manner in which racial matters have been defined and discussed changes abruptly .\\nAssumptions upon which people have come to rely are deemed mistaken , even dangerous , and they are required to embrace a whole new set of assumptions .\\nUnsurprisingly , the ethnic groups targeted by these new assumptions will be profoundly affected by such dramatic shifts in moral and political judgement .\\nIf it is an ethnic minority being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will become fearful .\\nBut , if the assumptions of the majority are being challenged , then many of its members will become extremely angry .\\nMost citizens , however , will struggle to take such shifts seriously .\\nThose making them will be branded extremists , and dismissed accordingly .\\nFor many Jews living in Germany at the time of the Nazi ’ s seizure of power in the early months of 1933 , the idea that their entire ethnic community was about to be threatened by actions infinitely more serious than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his followers seemed preposterous .\\nGermans were , after all , a highly civilised people , and their rulers , beginning in the Eighteenth Century , had been among the first to recognise Jews as citizens .\\nThe idea that they could be stripped of their citizenship , excluded from all aspects of social and economic life , robbed of their property and , ultimately their very lives , and all under the lawful direction of the state , was bizarre , unbelievable , obscene .\\nThey were right , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that didn ’ t make it untrue .\\nWhites living in the southern states of the United States found it equally preposterous that their “ separate but equal ” racial regime was about to be dismantled by the federal courts and the United States Congress .\\nWhite supremacy , legitimated through the states ’ racial segregation statutes , and enforced by the terror inspired by the Ku Klux Klan , constituted the “ normal ” state of affairs in the South , and most Southerners could not take seriously the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ Jim Crow ” status quo .\\nBut , muscle-in it did .\\nNot all that quickly , and not without horrific violence being visited upon the Black civil rights movement and its leaders , but in the end Southern Whites were forced to acknowledge ( if not entirely accept ) a new set of racial assumptions .\\nThe role of the federal courts , the Supreme Court in particular , in defining and imposing that new set of assumptions , and of the US Congress in translating them into effective legislation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supreme Court , and a differently composed Congress , could very easily have turned back the Civil Rights Movements ’ legal and political challenges – as had happened many times before .\\nA less progressive news media might have declined to stir the conscience of northern liberals by suppressing the images of Bull Connor ’ s fire-hoses and Alsatian dogs .\\nAs the recent judgements of the US Supreme Court have demonstrated , the progressive assumptions that brought down Jim Crow and ushered in a host of related social freedoms , were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the Supreme Court struck down school segregation in 1954 , the global struggle against the fanatical racism of the Nazis was less than a decade in the past .\\nIn 2022 , however , the proposition that the liberal victories of the late-Twentieth and early-Twenty-First centuries will stand unchallenged and unchanged forever has clearly been disproved .\\nThe hands of History ’ s clock can move backwards as well as forwards .\\nThe evolution of racial politics in New Zealand has arrived at its own moment of radically altered assumptions .\\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the institutions it bequeathed to the nation of New Zealand , are insulated from serious challenge , both by the passage of historical time , and the shared beliefs and values of Māori and Pakeha , is itself being challenged .\\nAn elite coalition of Māori nationalists , backed by sympathetic Pakeha intellectuals located strategically in New Zealand ’ s judicial , state , academic and media apparatus , has launched an ambitious attempt to “ decolonise ” the thinking of its Pakeha population , and “ indigenise ” the cultural , educational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ Aotearoa ” .\\nThis revolutionary constitutional reconfiguration , like the deconstruction of Jim Crow in the American South , is to be carried out with the consent of the white population , if possible ; or without it , if necessary .\\nThe key question raised by this strategy is whether or not enough New Zealanders can be convinced of the need for revolutionary constitutional change to overwhelm – either democratically or physically – the objections of those determined to preserve the status quo .\\nThat this is the crucial determinant of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , become clear until New Zealanders recognise the prospect of revolutionary change as a serious possibility .\\nAt the moment most of the New Zealand population continues to work on the assumption that Māori and Pakeha see each other as equals not adversaries .\\nIf they think about co-governance at all , they assume that it is simply a matter of giving Māori a stronger voice in matters that matter to them .\\nVery few Pakeha appreciate that being “ decolonised ” and “ indigenised ” is something that will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change them .\\nWhen they finally work that out , things could get ugly .\\nIn large measure , the final triumph of the Black Civil Rights Movement was the work of its enemies .\\nThe violence inflicted on non-violent protesters .\\nThe bombing and burning of churches .\\nThe murder of civil rights workers .\\nThese were the bloody talismans of segregation and white supremacy that allowed President Lyndon Johnson to assemble his congressional majority for the Voting Rights Act .\\nDr Martin Luther King understood that only by forcing white racism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indignation necessary to supplant it be kindled .\\nA race-driven revolution in New Zealand will succeed only if those promoting it are committed , and seen to be committed , to building a future in which whatyou are is of less importance that who you are .\\nIn Nazi Germany and the American South , what you were , Jew or Aryan , White or Black , was all that mattered .\\nIf New Zealand is a nation in which the assumptions of racial equality still hold sway , then any attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over their common humanity must end in failure .\\nIf , however , a decisive majority of New Zealanders reject racial equality , then the serious consequences of the revolutionary , race-based constitution that is sure to follow will not be slow in revealing themselves .',\n",

       "  'content': 'When officials who have been sitting at the negotiating table for a potentially far-reaching international agreement with the United States are asking “ what is this thing ?\\n” , serious questions need to be asked about why they are even there .\\nSome version of that question was asked of me as a “ stakeholder ” by three different delegations during the first round of negotiations on the US-driven Indo-Pacific Economic Framework ( IPEF ) last week in Brisbane .\\nIPEF is the centrepiece of the US ’ s strategy to counter the influence of China in the Asia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Japan , Australia and India .\\nThe four pillar framework of trade , resilient supply chains , clean economy and fair economy ( tax and corruption ) , is split between the US Trade Representative ( Pillar 1 ) and the Commerce Department for the rest .\\nChina is never mentioned , but the subtext is hardly subtle .\\nA recent statement from Australia ’ s Defence Department explicitly laid out the security objectives of the specific items on the IPEF agenda , from rules on data and targeting telcos such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended to marginalise China , and bans on export controls such as those applied to semi-conductors .\\nWhile IPEF focuses on the Asian region , the US is moving to reassert influence and counteract China through parallel Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity and US-Taiwan Initiative on 21st-Century Trade , a Pacific Partnership Strategy with the Pacific Islands countries , and a three-day summit last week with African leaders .\\nThree other factors are driving the US approach .\\nAs host for APEC in 2023 , the US just announced the theme “ Creating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” , which contains almost every element of IPEF .\\nClearly , Biden will want some deliverables by the Leaders ’ summit in San Francisco in November .\\nSecond , the Biden Administration needs to satisfy corporate and some congressional demands for free trade deals , while placating staunch critics of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement ( TPPA ) and similar deals by other Democrats , crucial union and environment constituencies over offshoring of jobs and lowering labour and environment standards .\\nThird , the administration describes the legal form as an “ executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach – a view strongly disputed by leading Democrats like Senator Elizabeth Warren .\\nHence , IPEF is not a “ traditional ” free trade agreement that grants market access to the US .\\nIn Brisbane , its chief negotiator portrayed IPEF as a new and innovative economic arrangement to address 21st century challenges .\\nClose US allies , such as Japan , dutifully echoed their excitement about this innovative new approach and its references to gender , indigenous peoples and labour .\\nSome governments seemed reassured by the US ’ s lower-key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that .\\nThe US invented the idea of IPEF and has vice-like control .\\nIt secured support from the Quad and now has 14 participatory countries from across the region – some , I suspect , as part of quid pro quos .\\nParticipating governments could only access documents after they signed a draconian agreement that keeps negotiating documents secret for five years after the outcome enters into force .\\nThe US chairs all the negotiating committees , except that on “ inclusivity ” ( co-convened by Australia and New Zealand ) .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ meetings of each chapter and tabled the early drafts for discussion .\\nThose drafts , including some texts , reflect the pro-corporate provisions in the TPPA , US Mexico Canada Agreement ( USMCA ) and other recent negotiations .\\nThat reflects the demands of the US corporate lobby , which has reinvented itself as the American Association of the Indo-Pacific .\\nCorporate speakers at the Brisbane stakeholder session , such as Amazon and Citi , focused narrowly on their wish list for digital , digital , digital .\\nSo did a joint statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including Business NZ and the Australian Services Roundtable .\\nWhile the US objectives are clear , the “ thing ” itself is a mess .\\nThe US has adopted a Nike-approach of “ Just do it ” .\\nThere is no coherence across the four pillars , despite significant overlap , or even for the elements within each .\\nSome topics are advanced , because they largely cross-reference existing texts , while others are embryonic .\\nMeeting in fragmented , simultaneous silos puts a massive burden on small delegations like Fiji .\\nNo-one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreements might take , whether some or all parts would be enforceable , whether countries can pick and choose different elements , how sensitivities can be protected , what development flexibilities might be permitted and resources would be made to implement them .\\nEffectively , governments are being asked to negotiate a pig in a poke .\\nAbove all , there is no evidence that IPEF will be of any value to any participating countries beyond showing willing to the US in its geo-political strategy to counter China .\\nWe deserve a much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .',\n",

       "  'content': 'Projecting the view that “ authoritarian Russia ” can not be trusted to report the truth about the war in Ukraine , Western media presents its coverage as trustworthy because its reports , it asserts , are the result of “ free and independent ” inquiry .\\nWell , a new study evaluating media coverage of the war in Ukraine has found it to have been overwhelmingly biased in favour of the Western narrative from the outset , and so to be playing a major role in perpetuating the conflict .\\nThe study found that of almost 4.300 published articles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universally biased in favour of Ukraine , were pro-war , and were anti-Russia .\\nUkraine was portrayed positively in 64 % of all coverage , and President Vladimir Zelensky in 67 % .\\nBy contrast Russia was portrayed “ almost exclusively negatively ” 88 % of the time , and President Putin portrayed negatively in almost all , 96 % , of stories published .\\n93 % of all the reports on the war attributed sole blame for it on President Putin and/or Russia , while The West was named as “ jointly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instances , Ukraine even less so at 2 % .\\nThe report also found that Russia ’ s perspectives on the conflict were only considered or mentioned in 10 % of news reports , and the views of those opposed to the war “ had practically no media presence in the published reporting of the war , ” at all .\\nOverall , the study offers a disturbing view of how the Western media has lined up behind the Western narrative , as to the cause of war , while consideration of alternative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supporting a diplomatic settlement , have been almost completely absent , or withheld from any reporting or analysis .\\nDescribing the Western media as the most aggressive and effective lobbyists for war , the report contends that similar investigations of the conflict in other Western countries would inevitably reach similar conclusions .\\n“ In many cases , the findings could possibly be even more drastic , in terms of the one-sided , pro-war picture presented to average citizens by the press , and the lack of opposing , pro-diplomacy viewpoints ” , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western media makes little or no mention of NATO ’ s incremental creep towards Russia since the fall of communism , or of assurances given at the time , or of the Minsk agreements , One and Two , which were brokered between Ukraine and Russia at the instigation of France and Germany and which , but for Ukraine ’ s refusal to respect them , Russia ’ s February invasion would not have taken place .\\nAnd the media also failed to publish the peace initiative brokered when Kiev and Moscow reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whereby Russia would withdraw to its pre-February 24 position , and Ukraine would promise not to seek NATO membership in return for security guarantees from a number of countries .\\nHowever , at the very last minute , then-UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson reportedly flew to Kiev and demanded that Zelensky step away from the talks , a shocking fact that has barely been mentioned in English-language news media .\\nIgnoring Russia ’ s concerns , a specific narrative which projects Russia as a ‘ neo-Soviet autocracy ’ is being fostered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project the United States and the American-led West as the ‘ free world ’ relative to that of an ‘ oppressive ’ Russia .\\nWhile the report found that anything other than a one-sided pro-Western perspective on the war and its causes is singularly lacking in Western media , contrary views are also generally absent from the internet .\\nThis report , for instance , was nowhere to be found on Google search and the only copy I could get was obtained directly from the University of Mainz , but that only in @ @',\n",

       " 'content': 'Simply dismissing , as idiots , those who reject what our government and its science advisors have instructed us about Covid 19 , doesn ’ t help .\\nWhile debates over Covid can be between friends and colleagues , I ’ m concerned that when they involve those ‘ closer to home , ’ the likely long term effects of Covid , risk damaging families for even longer .\\nMore than splits caused by differences over political or religious convictions , most often parlayed in good humoured banter , the seismic cracks caused by the Covid conspiracy debate could take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surrounding landscape .\\nIt all started when a casual comment about the need for us to all follow the new government measures to beat Covid brought forth such a torrent of the now familiar Covid conspiracy rhetoric , from a family member , and I was shocked .\\nWhile we ’ d always hoped that our kids ’ upbringing would instil a certain healthy scepticism , I didn ’ t expect this .\\nBut worse was to come .\\nAfter researching a raft of authoritative material which I thought fairly debunked all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emailed it off , back came an even more violent rebuttal , with some additional “ home truths ” thrown in for good measure .\\nSince then , now many months on , an ozone hole of iciness has opened over our family and the clear signs of a catastrophic climate change seem undeniable .\\nSo I thought I ’ d do some more research and try and find out what has induced so many to be convinced by information so radically opposed to that accepted by the vast majority .\\nWriting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doesn ’ t work with anti-vaxxers because it just reinforces in them the idea that “ I ’ m a brainwashed servant of a conspiracy involving , the government , big pharma and the mainstream media.\\n” And while there are those on the right who are only too ready to exploit people willing to believe the world is not as it appears , Bartlett says the time he spent researching his article , convinced him that the “ antis ” are neither disingenuous nor right-wing nut cases .\\nSo what is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such numbers ?\\nWhat Bartlett noted whenever he produced a verifiable fact , the anti-vaxxer ’ s argument would immediately shift to a different belief system , full of “ coruscating levels of excruciating , nonsensical detail unearthed from ( selective ) online research.\\n” And that certainly tallies with my experience .\\nFor instance Covid conspiracy theorists seem to lack even the slightest appreciation of the astronomical organisational requirements , involving nations literally at war with one another , for such a scheme to ever work .\\n“ But , ” says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fundamentalism where what you believe isn ’ t as important as what you don ’ t believe .\\nWhatever is happening isn ’ t happening .\\nWhatever reality is , they ’ re opposed to it .\\nWhich makes the movement uniquely dangerous.\\n” They exude , “ A sense of righteous zeal that makes them feel that are at war , and so justified in the most extreme actions .\\nThey can harass , they can abuse , they can spread half-truths in the name of their holy mission .\\nThey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of us , fighting an injustice that nobody else can see.\\n” In trying to fathom where all that suddenly came from Bartlett says ; “ This devotion to a cause brings with it a great deal of emotional investment , Their noble mission – whether it ’ s being anti-vaccine or anti-lockdown measures – it ’ s a core part of their identity.\\n” And Bartlett blames education , or a lack of it , for the problem .\\nWhat ’ s needed , he says , is a long-term focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ critical literacy ” .\\nPeople who know how to read the media , with all its biases and omissions , will be less vulnerable to cranks .\\nAnd he argues for a greater focus on basic civics , a simple understanding of how the system works .\\nTo me that echoes a little of nuclear physicist Neil deGrass Tyson ’ s famous quote ; “ The great challenge of life : – Knowing enough to think you ’ re right , but not enough to know you ’ re wrong.\\n” Bartlett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump election campaign which he says , empowered conspiracy theorists by legitimising their ignorance .\\n“ Suddenly knowing nothing was imbued with a certain kind of purity or genius , ” he says .\\nAnd he concludes by advising that a conversation on this subject shouldn ’ t be a battle for a winner and a loser , but for a chance to find some common ground , on which relationships can be still maintained .\\nAnd that makes sense , except that , in my experience , when sides divided by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide what the mask and social distancing protocols are – that ’ s when the argument starts .',\n",

      "“ It was for health reasons with its cultural and societal impacts that made the campaign difficult , it was not fundamentally for political reasons .\n",

      "“ Its expected result was a defeat for the cause of independence .\n",

      "“ Just as Palestine is the only intact European settler-colony in the Arab world after the end of Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1950s , the end of French settler-colonialism in Morocco and Tunisia in the 1950s , and the liberation of Algeria in 1962 ( some of Algeria ’ s French colonists left for New Caledonia ) , Kanaky remains the only major country subject to French settler-colonialism after the independence of most of its island neighbours .\n",
      "“ As with the colonised Palestinians , who have less rights than those acquired by the Kanaks in the last half century , and who remain subject to the racialised power of their colonisers , the colonised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the white French colonists and their mother country .\n",
      "“ No wonder [ President Emmanuel ] Macron is as ebullient and proud as Israel ’ s leaders.\n",
      "” West Papuan hopes elusive as violence worsens Hopes for a new United Nations-supervised referendum for West Papua have remained elusive for the Melanesian region colonised by Indonesia in the 1960s and annexed after a sham plebiscite known euphemistically as the “ Act of Free Choice ” in 1969 when 1025 men and women hand-picked by the Indonesian military voted unanimously in favour of Indonesian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two years ago the United Liberation Movement of West Papua ( ULMWP ) was formed to step up the international diplomatic effort for Papuan self-determination and independence .\n",
      "However , at the same time armed resistance has grown and Indonesia has responded with a massive build up of more than 20,000 troops in the two Melanesian provinces of Papua and West Papua and an exponential increase on human rights violations and draconian measures by the Jakarta authorities .\n",
      "As 2021 ended , interim West Papuan president-in-exile Benny Wenda distributed a Christmas message thanking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solidarity groups , the International Parliamentarians for West Papua , the International Lawyers for West Papua , all those across the world who continue to tirelessly support us .\n",
      "“ Religious leaders , NGOs , politicians , diplomats , individuals , everyone who has helped us in the Pacific , Caribbean , Africa , America , Europe , UK : thank you.\n",
      "” Wenda sounded an optimistic note in his message : “ Our goal is getting closer .\n",
      "Please help us keep up the momentum in 2022 with your prayers , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making history through your support , which will help us achieve independence.\n",
      "” But Wenda was also frank about the grave situation facing West Papua , which was “ getting worse and worse ” .\n",
      "“ We continue to demand that the Indonesian government release the eight students arrested on December 1 for peacefully calling for their right to self-determination .\n",
      "We also demand that the military operations , which continue in Intan Jaya , Puncak , Nduga and elsewhere , cease , ” he said , adding condemnation of Jakarta for using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights visiting West Papua .\n",
      "New covid-19 wave hits Fiji Fiji , which had already suffered earlier in 2021 along with Guam and French Polynesia as one of the worst hit Pacific countries hit by the covid-19 pandemic , is now in the grip of a third wave of infection with 780 active cases .\n",

      "Health Secretary Dr James Fong is yet to confirm whether these cases were of the delta variant or the more highly contagious omicron mutant .\n",
      "It may just be a resurgence of the endemic delta variant , says Dr Fong , “ however we are also working on the assumption that the omicron variant is already here , and is being transmitted within the community .\n",
      "“ We expect that genomic sequencing results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirm this in due course.\n",
      "” A DevPolicy blog article at Australian National University earlier in 2021 warned against applying Western notions of public health to the Pacific country .\n",
      "Communal living is widespread across squatter settlements , urban villages , and other residential areas in the Lami-Suva-Nausori containment zone .\n",
      "“ Household sizes are generally bigger than in Western countries , and households often include three generations .\n",
      "This means elderly people are more at risk as they can not easily isolate .\n",
      "At the same time , identifying a ‘ household @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ‘ bubble ’ is difficult .\n",
      "“ ‘ Stay home ’ is equally difficult to define , because the concept of ‘ home ’ has a broader meaning in the Fijian context compared to Western societies.\n",
      "” While covid pandemic crises are continuing to wreak havoc in some Pacific communities into 2022 , the urgency of climate change still remains the critical issue facing the region .\n",

and turned it into a penal colony for political prisoners .\\nKanaky turbulence in 1980s A turbulent period in the 1980s – known locally as “ Les événements ” – culminated in a farcical referendum on independence in 1987 which returned a 98 percent rejection of independence .\\nThis was boycotted by the pro-independence groups when then President François Mitterrand broke a promise that short-term French residents would not be able to vote .\\nThe turnout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demographics .\\nThe UN Special Committee on Decolonisation declined to send observers as that plebiscite did not honour the process of “ decolonisation ” .\\nA Kanak international advocate of the Confédération Nationale du Travail ( CNT ) trade union and USTKE member , Rock Haocas , says from Paris that the latest referendum is “ a betrayal ” of the past three decades of progress and jeopardises negotiations for a future statute on the future of Kanaky New Caledonia .\\nThe pro-independence parties have refused to negotiate on the future until after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year .\\nA new political arrangement is due in 18 months .\\nIn the meantime , the result is being challenged in France ’ s constitutional court .\\n“ The people have made concessions , ” Haocas told Asia Pacific Report , referencing the many occasions indigenous Kanaks have done so , such as : • Concessions to the “ two colours , one people ” agreement with the Union Caledonian party in 1953 ; • Recognition of the “ victims of history ” in Nainville-Les-Roches in 1983 ; • The Matignon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nouméa Accord in 1998 ; and • The opening of the electoral body ( to the native ) .\\n‘ Getting closer to each other ’ “ The period of the agreements allowed the different communities to get to know each other , to get closer to each other , to be together in schools , to work together in companies and development projects , to travel in France , the Pacific , and in other countries , ” says Haocas .\\n“ It ’ s also the time of the internet .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it faces the world .\\nPeople talk about it more easily .\\nThe demand for independence has become more explainable , and more exportable .\\nThere has been more talk of interdependence , and no longer of a strict break with France .\\n“ But for the last referendum France banked on the fear of one with the other to preserve its own interests.\\n” Is this a return to the dark days of 1987 when France conducted the “ sham referendum ” ?\\n“ We ’ re not really in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the framework of the Nouméa Accord with three consultations — and for which we asked for the postponement of the last one scheduled for December 12 , ” says Haocas .\\n“ It was for health reasons with its cultural and societal impacts that made the campaign difficult , it was not fundamentally for political reasons .\\n“ The French state does not discuss , does not seek consensus — it imposes , even if it means going back on its word.\\n” Haocas says it is now time to reflect and analyse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The result of the ballot box speaks for itself .\\nNote the calm in the pro-independence world .\\nNow there are no longer three actors — the indépendantistes , the anti-independence and the state – but two , the indépendantistes and the state.\\n” Comparisons between Kanaky and Palestine In a devastating critique of the failings of the referendum and of the sincerity of France ’ s about-turn in its three-decade decolonisation policy , Professor Joseph Massad , a specialist in modern Arab politics and intellectual history at Columbia University , New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartheid in Palestine .\\n“ Its expected result was a defeat for the cause of independence .\\nIt seems that European settler-colonies remain beholden to the white colonists , not only in the larger white settler-colonies in the Americas and Oceania , but also in the smaller ones , whether in the South Pacific , Southern Africa , Palestine , or Hawai ’ i , ” wrote Dr Massad in Middle East Eye .\\n“ Just as Palestine is the only intact European settler-colony in the Arab world after the end of Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1950s , the end of French settler-colonialism in Morocco and Tunisia in the 1950s , and the liberation of Algeria in 1962 ( some of Algeria ’ s French colonists left for New Caledonia ) , Kanaky remains the only major country subject to French settler-colonialism after the independence of most of its island neighbours .\\n“ As with the colonised Palestinians , who have less rights than those acquired by the Kanaks in the last half century , and who remain subject to the racialised power of their colonisers , the colonised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the white French colonists and their mother country .\\n“ No wonder [ President Emmanuel ] Macron is as ebullient and proud as Israel ’ s leaders.\\n” West Papuan hopes elusive as violence worsens Hopes for a new United Nations-supervised referendum for West Papua have remained elusive for the Melanesian region colonised by Indonesia in the 1960s and annexed after a sham plebiscite known euphemistically as the “ Act of Free Choice ” in 1969 when 1025 men and women hand-picked by the Indonesian military voted unanimously in favour of Indonesian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two years ago the United Liberation Movement of West Papua ( ULMWP ) was formed to step up the international diplomatic effort for Papuan self-determination and independence .\\nHowever , at the same time armed resistance has grown and Indonesia has responded with a massive build up of more than 20,000 troops in the two Melanesian provinces of Papua and West Papua and an exponential increase on human rights violations and draconian measures by the Jakarta authorities .\\nAs 2021 ended , interim West Papuan president-in-exile Benny Wenda distributed a Christmas message thanking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solidarity groups , the International Parliamentarians for West Papua , the International Lawyers for West Papua , all those across the world who continue to tirelessly support us .\\n“ Religious leaders , NGOs , politicians , diplomats , individuals , everyone who has helped us in the Pacific , Caribbean , Africa , America , Europe , UK : thank you.\\n” Wenda sounded an optimistic note in his message : “ Our goal is getting closer .\\nPlease help us keep up the momentum in 2022 with your prayers , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making history through your support , which will help us achieve independence.\\n” But Wenda was also frank about the grave situation facing West Papua , which was “ getting worse and worse ” .\\n“ We continue to demand that the Indonesian government release the eight students arrested on December 1 for peacefully calling for their right to self-determination .\\nWe also demand that the military operations , which continue in Intan Jaya , Puncak , Nduga and elsewhere , cease , ” he said , adding condemnation of Jakarta for using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights visiting West Papua .\\nNew covid-19 wave hits Fiji Fiji , which had already suffered earlier in 2021 along with Guam and French Polynesia as one of the worst hit Pacific countries hit by the covid-19 pandemic , is now in the grip of a third wave of infection with 780 active cases .\\nFiji ’ s Health Ministry has reported one death and 309 new cases of covid-19 in the community since Christmas Day — 194 of them confirmed in the 24 hours just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nThis is another blow to the tourism industry just at a time when it was seeking to rebuild .\\nHealth Secretary Dr James Fong is yet to confirm whether these cases were of the delta variant or the more highly contagious omicron mutant .\\nIt may just be a resurgence of the endemic delta variant , says Dr Fong , “ however we are also working on the assumption that the omicron variant is already here , and is being transmitted within the community .\\n“ We expect that genomic sequencing results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirm this in due course.\\n” A DevPolicy blog article at Australian National University earlier in 2021 warned against applying Western notions of public health to the Pacific country .\\nCommunal living is widespread across squatter settlements , urban villages , and other residential areas in the Lami-Suva-Nausori containment zone .\\n“ Household sizes are generally bigger than in Western countries , and households often include three generations .\\nThis means elderly people are more at risk as they can not easily isolate .\\nAt the same time , identifying a ‘ household @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ‘ bubble ’ is difficult .\\n“ ‘ Stay home ’ is equally difficult to define , because the concept of ‘ home ’ has a broader meaning in the Fijian context compared to Western societies.\\n” While covid pandemic crises are continuing to wreak havoc in some Pacific communities into 2022 , the urgency of climate change still remains the critical issue facing the region .\\nAfter the lacklustre COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow , Scotland , in November , Pacific leaders — who were mostly unable to attend due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up their global advocacy .\\nEnd of ’ empty promises ’ on climate Cook Islands Prime Minister Mark Brown appealed in a powerful article that it was time for the major nations producing global warming emissions to shelve their “ empty promises ” and finally deliver on climate financing .\\n‘ As custodians of these islands , we have a moral duty to protect [ them ] — for today and the unborn generations of our Pacific anau .\\nSadly , we are unable to do that because of things beyond our control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nOur food security is at risk , and our way of life that we have known for generations is slowly disappearing .\\nWhat were ‘ once in a lifetime ’ extreme events like category 5 cyclones , marine heatwaves and the like are becoming more severe .\\n“ Despite our negligible contribution to global emissions , this is the price we pay .\\nWe are talking about homes , lands and precious lives ; many are being displaced as we speak.\\n” Perhaps the most perceptive reflections of the year came from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student activist , Marylou Mahé .\\nSaying that as a “ decolonial feminist ” she wished to put an end to “ injustice and humiliation of my people ” , Mahé added a message familiar to many Pacific Islanders : “ As a young Kanak woman , my voice is often silenced , but I want to remind the world that we are here , we are standing , and we are acting for our future .\\nThe state ’ s spoken word may die tomorrow , but our right to recognition and @ @ @ @ @'"
