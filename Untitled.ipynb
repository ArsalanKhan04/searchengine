       " 'content': \"One of the most disturbing concepts in politics is the media elite providing the “ first draft of history.\\n” You can test-drive this with a look at ABC ’ s two-hour year-end special on December 27 .\\nIt was mostly about celebrities and athletes and some natural disasters .\\nBut when President Biden came up , ABC was energetically playing defense .\\nIt began with Biden 's inauguration and Trump 's second impeachment proceeding , over the January 6 riot…when Trump was already replaced .\\nABC anchorman David Muir announced : “ Back at the White House -- A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combat COVID , and the return of the White House briefing after its conspicuous absence.\\n” What ?\\nKayleigh McEnany wasn ’ t briefing the press in 2020 ?\\nABC somehow pretended Jen Psaki took over from Stephanie Grisham oddly never holding a briefing .\\nMuir proclaimed : “ On the world stage , Biden touted a return to diplomacy , resetting relationships with our allies , repositioning America in the fight against climate change.\\n” There was zero mention of a border crisis .\\nThe roughest minute or so was on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost Marines and bungled drone strike killing ten civilians .\\nBut they re-ran Biden telling ABC there were no mistakes , that it was impossible to withdraw without chaos .\\nOn COVID , they re-ran Muir asking Biden “ We 're nearly two years into this pandemic .\\nYou 're a year into the presidency .\\nEmpty shelves and no test kits in some places , when it 's so important .\\nIs that good enough ?\\n” Biden said no , but he touted how many Americans were vaccinated .\\nABC never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died , more than half of that since Biden 's inauguration , after vaccines were available .\\nThere was no clip of Biden boasting in 2020 he would “ shut down the virus.\\n” Muir shifted the tone : “ All the while , the signs of hope .\\nThe reunions and the bright spots.\\n” ABC touted passage of the “ bipartisan infrastructure bill , ” and then noted “ progressives ” held out for a much larger spending package .\\nThey inserted a bizarre soundbite from actress Ryan Michelle Bathe about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a birthday cake for picky kids .\\nDemocrats were flustered by Sen. Manchin betraying the party by refusing to support the larger bill , but then those Republicans !\\nWhite House reporter Jonathan Karl jauntily declared “ Democrats have deep divisions , but the Republican party is a mess !\\n” George Stephanopoulos warned “ Republicans reckoned with the outsized influence of former President Trump… As an emboldened , often controversial wing of the party emerges ” ( picture of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene ) .\\nSo are the Republicans a “ mess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking ?\\nThey want everything to be about Trump .\\nThey 're invested in his GOP-wrecking potential .\\nStephanopoulos continued : “ Even those who condemned Trump 's actions on January 6th…gravitated back to the former president…Largely refusing to publicly debunk Trump 's big election lie , ostracizing those who spoke out .\\nCongresswoman Liz Cheney is ousted from her leadership post.\\n” Notice that Joe Manchin betrayed his party , but Liz Cheney is a truth-telling hero .\\nThat sounds like a Stephanopoulos spin .\\nRecent polls show Republicans are strongly positioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a “ pounce , ” as expected .\\n“ Ahead of next year 's midterms , Democrats on alert after suffering a stinging loss in Virginia 's gubernatorial race .\\nRepublicans ready to pounce as Biden 's popularity takes a perilous dive , setting up what promises to be another unpredictable , pivotal year in American politics.\\n” Terry McAuliffe lost in Virginia despite mentioning Trump incessantly , but the Democrats at ABC can only insist 2022 is going to be “ unpredictable.\\n” Sadly for them , they can ’ t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote for Democrats .\",\n",
