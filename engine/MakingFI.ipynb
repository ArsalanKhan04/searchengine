but has a major offer on the table from Real Madrid as well as interest from Bayern Munich and feeling at Chelsea is he wants out having rejected contract offers .\\nVeteran defender may be 37 now but shows his class every time he plays .\\nHe seems settled in West London but the fact no new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fans .\\nA big target of Newcastle as they seek to avoid the drop , but Burnley have to decide

pretentious and nonsensical .\\nBut surely , God willing , surely 2022 has to be a year that we can all look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hope after the shocking past 22 months we ’ ve had .\\nHope can be amazing .\\nIt ’ s often what keeps us going .\\nAnd it ’ s all we have , right ?\\nThere were some big changes in my personal life in the past year .\\nI made some big shifts .\\nThe biggest was dipping my toe into the turbulent sea of dating .\\nNay , I may have gone in over my shoulders .\\nIt was unintentional and if it hadn ’ t been for lockdown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nIt began as a distraction and soon became a fascination .\\nStuck at home with kids , not permitted to go anywhere , it was nice to strike up conversations with people , albeit virtually .\\nTurns out some of them were real and some considerably less so .\\nBut it was an interesting learning curve .\\nI was ready to mingle .\\nI had a newfound freedom and , with my children being a bit older , a sense of independence .\\nIt energised me and catapulted me into a world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having sex .\\nI felt like I was born again .\\nI had a lot of great times but there were also some soul-destroying moments which left me feeling empty and often sad .\\nThere were men who initially showed enthusiasm , positivity and willingness , only for it to be deflated like a giant balloon due to their fears , anxieties or — who knows ?\\n— panic .\\nSince my divorce three and a half years ago , I ’ d had no appetite for meeting someone .\\nI was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ ve been in one for a lengthy period , you crave space , time on your own , lack of commitment , freedom , a life devoid of boundaries and restrictions .\\nAn opportunity to breathe and spread your wings .\\nTo be fair , for much of my life I ’ ve been in long-term relationships , one after the other with only brief breaks in between but barely enough time to work out what it is you really need and want .\\nWhat you want is often very different from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been a relationship person .\\nI ’ ve loved the connection and the commitment .\\nI ’ ve always wanted to belong to someone .\\nTo know there is someone who counts on me , someone I can care for .\\nIf you have children , which I ’ ve had for the past 27 years , you ’ re constantly caring for and nurturing others .\\nYou ’ re all too often bottom of the list because everyone else is a priority — and I think I always liked that .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ DNA .\\nI had never really known anything else and would have felt lost if I didn ’ t have someone else to care for .\\nPerhaps that is why my commitment to a relationship was always so fervent .\\nIt was like a fire burning inside me .\\nAdded to that was the eternal romantic in me constantly searching for The One .\\nI believed in monogamy and had it in my head we all ought to be with someone .\\nI can ’ t explain where this came from because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so I never had a clear vision of a nuclear family .\\nWith the advent of my third divorce , and the turbulence brought on by the devastating menopause , my desires and wishes changed .\\nThis coincided with a pandemic , lockdowns and Project Dating .\\nFinally , after three years of being single , I was dating .\\nI had a couple of encounters where I could feel my heart race , my face flush with the onset of promise and affection , and a sensation I might be heading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those couple of “ collisions ” that have finally made me realise what I ’ m hoping for in 2022 .\\nI don ’ t want to rule out any more brief encounters .\\nAfter all , we all know meeting someone special is a numbers game .\\nIt ’ s crucial you don ’ t put all your eggs in one basket .\\nWhat I ’ ve concluded is that sex and fun is .\\n.\\n.\\nfun .\\nIt ’ s liberating , exciting and confidence-boosting .\\nBut it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year .\\nI ’ m largely done with one-offs and rendezvous of brevity .\\nIt was good while it lasted and it helped re-engage me with members of the opposite sex .\\nIt was enlightening .\\nBut I want more .\\nFear not , this bird isn ’ t searching for another Mr Right .\\nShe isn ’ t looking to settle down yet again .\\nShe ’ s not looking for something conventional .\\nI want something I never thought would be very “ me ” .\\nI ’ m hoping I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about myself and others this past year to fashion myself some kind of relationship not bound by normal custom .\\nI am a fiercely independent woman and I do not need a man .\\nI am happy in my own company , thank you .\\nI ’ m not needy and I don ’ t chase .\\nWhat I hope for is someone in my life willing to appreciate and respect me for who I am .\\nSomeone honest and dedicated to some form of “ us ” — but an “ us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in each other ’ s pocket .\\nI don ’ t need someone to take my children on .\\nI don ’ t need help changing lightbulbs .\\nWhat I would like is to be loved and cherished while doing all the fun things life can unfold .\\nI want laughter and good times without the argument over who is loading the dishwasher tonight .\\nI want trips away .\\nI want a love affair that will last only for as long as it is meant to .\\nI am not searching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I sure as hell will be ready when it arrives .\\nMy intention is not to march into 2022 , making it my year and raising expectations .\\nI ’ m hopeful .\\nI shall walk in quietly — but a little assumingly .\\nNo angel , but she 's my hero ONE of the most captivating dramas I watched last week was the BBC ’ s A Very British Scandal , a dramatisation of the society story surrounding the divorce between the Duke and Duchess of Argyll in 1963 .\\nSublime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but an apt telling of a true story where a woman was publicly shamed for , fundamentally , being “ highly sexed ” .\\nThe duchess , Margaret Campbell , had many lovers .\\nShe enjoyed sex and , in her own opinion , she was very good at it .\\nAnd regardless of her husband ’ s numerous infidelities and cruel behaviour , it was she who was discredited , humiliated and ridiculed for her love of intercourse and intimacy .\\nI would like to think things have changed over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent they have .\\nWe are more willing to discuss the fact that women can and have the right to enjoy sex as a recreational pastime .\\nBut essentially much of society still finds it a somewhat uncomfortable concept .\\nWe are definitely heading in the right direction and hopefully the next generation of women can feel more at ease – like I certainly do – about expressing their desires and passions without feeling shame or exclusion .\\nSo , I have found myself a new heroine in the former Duchess of Argyll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social outcast in 1993 .\\nShe may not have been an angel , but what a trailblazer for owning her sexuality at a time when being sexually liberated was a cause for stigma and scandal .\\nTHERE can ’ t be many whose Christmastime was untouched by flaming Omicron .\\nA member of my family , albeit one who doesn ’ t live at home any more , contracted this deeply frustrating variant , which meant said person would not be out of isolation until Boxing Day .\\nThere were tears all round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an end .\\n.\\n.\\nuntil we had the genius idea of moving the Christmas plans around a bit .\\nAnd I have to confess it has been an enlightening festive period , if for that alone .\\nWe ( meaning “ I ” because , quite frankly , I am the boss of Chrimbo ) moved Christmas Day to Boxing Day , which meant something glorious happened .\\nAfter a busy , fraught Eve , I then had a day of doing sweet bugger-all on the actual day .\\nInstead of having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungover , to perform yet another catering miracle of turkey and trimmings , I got to slob on the sofa in my comfies , watching films and eating leftovers .\\nNow , I ’ m a stickler for tradition .\\nBut this change meant I actually enjoyed Christmas Day for the first time in a long time because I wasn ’ t run ragged .\\nIt also meant I could look forward to the following day without feeling like I ’ d just done an Iron Man event .\\nSometimes man plans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made .\\nAnd I ’ m quite excited that a new tradition may have been born .\\nNumber 's up for feeling your age FIFTY Shades star Dakota Johnson , 32 , said in a recent interview that she feels both 26 and 48 , because she ’ s had “ a lot of life in her life ” .\\nBy this , she implies that she lived a lot in her younger years and therefore feels “ older ” .\\nI hear her .\\nAlthough , obvs , I ’ d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young bird myself who is about to turn the corner on 55 this year .\\nI ’ ve always struggled with the concept of age .\\nI had to grow up very young due to family circumstances .\\nI lived with a dad who often forgot he had a daughter and was thus left to my own devices to drag myself up .\\nThen , of course , I settled down really young , married at 23 and had the responsibility of both a family life and a successful career , which meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal “ stuff ” young people do .\\nI simply had too much responsibility on my young , tender shoulders .\\nIn short , I ’ ve lived my life back to front , because nowadays you ’ ll often find me hanging around with younger people .\\nI ’ m electrified , motivated and invigorated by their energy .\\nSo no , I don ’ t feel 54 .\\nI don ’ t know what 54 actually means .\\nMy head is now in the place it should have been when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , my love of rum invariably means I wake up the morning after , look in the mirror and see a 74-year-old .\\nBut such is life .\",\n",
